<p class="p2">Nick Carter stands for an interesting detective story. The fact
that the books in this line are so uniformly good is entirely due to
the work of a specialist. The man who wrote these stories produced
no other type of fiction. His mind was concentrated upon the creation
of new plots and situations in which his hero emerged triumphantly
from all sorts of troubles and landed the criminal just where
he should be—behind the bars.</p>

<p>The author of these stories knew more about writing detective stories
than any other single person.</p>

<p>Following is a list of the best Nick Carter stories. They have been
selected with extreme care, and we unhesitatingly recommend each of
them as being fully as interesting as any detective story between cloth
covers which sells at ten times the price.</p>

<p>If you do not know Nick Carter, buy a copy of any of the New
Magnet Library books, and get acquainted. He will surprise and delight
you.</p>

<h2 class="no-break">CHAPTER I.
<br />
<small>AN INQUISITIVE CLERK.</small></h2>


<p>“Bureau of Secret Investigation.”</p>

<p>Nick Carter glanced at the above sign over the door,
an unpretentious and somewhat faded reminder of better
days, while he descended the flight of stone steps leading
into the basement offices of the Boston police department.</p>

<p>The sunlight lay warm and bright in Pemberton
Square at ten o’clock that May morning, shedding over
the magnificent new court-house a golden glory consistent,
no doubt, with the wise dispensation of justice,
yet in monstrous anomaly with some of the dreadful experiences
and grim episodes sometimes enacted within
those splendid sunlit walls.</p>

<p>Nick turned to the right in the main corridor and
entered the adjoining office, quite a commodious room,
in which the general business of this secret service branch
of the local police department was conducted.</p>

<p>The enclosure back of the chief clerk’s high desk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
which also was topped with a brass grating, happened to
be vacant when Nick entered. In one corner of the
room, however, a subordinate clerk was busily engaged
in attempting to repair a slight leak in the faucet of the
ice-water vessel, and to this young man the famous New
York detective addressed himself.</p>

<p>“Has the chief been in this morning?” he asked.</p>

<p>The clerk bobbed up from his work as if startled, drying
his hands with his handkerchief, and stared sharply
at Nick for several moments. But he saw nothing familiar
in the stranger’s grave, clean-cut features.</p>

<p>For all that this clerk knew, or surmised, Nick might
have been an ordinary or very humble citizen, who had
quietly dropped in there for want of something better
to do.</p>

<p>“Chief Weston?” he returned inquiringly, still sharply
scrutinizing Nick.</p>

<p>“There is no other chief in this department, is there?”
was Nick’s reply, with a subtle tinge of irony.</p>

<p>“Well—no.”</p>

<p>“Chief Weston, yes,” bowed Nick. “Is he in his
office?”</p>

<p>“I believe so.”</p>

<p>“Busy?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he is, just now.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>“Reckon, eh? Don’t you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, he’s busy,” the clerk now said, a bit curtly,
flushing slightly under the detective’s keen eye and
quietly persistent inquiries.</p>

<p>“He’s not too busy to see me, I think,” replied Nick,
with dry assurance. “Go in and tell him I’m here.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Never mind who I am.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take in your card.”</p>

<p>“No card,” said Nick tersely.</p>

<p>“Your name, then?”</p>

<p>“Nor any name.”</p>

<p>“But——”</p>

<p>“Merely tell the chief that his friend from New York
is here.”</p>

<p>The expression in the eyes of the irritated clerk lost
none of its searching interest, yet they now took on a
rather different light, as if he had been suddenly hit
with an idea. Yet he still frowned slightly and said:</p>

<p>“If you object to having your name mentioned——”</p>

<p>“I do object, young man,” Nick now interrupted, with
ominously quiet determination. “Your chief may possibly
have persons in his office before whom I do not care
to have my name announced. Now, you go to him and
deliver my message just as I gave it to you, neither more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
nor less, or you’ll very suddenly hear something drop—providing
you still retain your senses.”</p>

<p>Now the clerk laughed, as if amused by the cool
terms of the quiet threat, and then he turned quickly and
vanished into a short passageway between the outer room
and Chief Weston’s private office.</p>

<p>Nick gazed after him with a rather quizzical stare—a
slender chap of about twenty-five, with reddish hair,
thin features, a sallow complexion thickly dotted with
freckles, and a countenance lighted by a pair of narrow
gray eyes, that greenish-gray sometimes seen in the eyes
of a cat.</p>

<p>“I wonder what use they have for him around here?”
Nick said to himself, while waiting. “If I were chief in
this joint, it’s long odds that that red-headed monkey
would get his walking-ticket in short order.”</p>

<p>The subject of these uncomplimentary cogitations returned
in less than a minute.</p>

<p>“You are to walk right in, sir—this way,” he glibly
announced, with much more deference.</p>

<p>At the same time he opened the way for Nick to pass
into the enclosure, and through the passage mentioned.</p>

<p>“Thank you,” said Nick, with half a growl.</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it,” grinned the clerk. “Straight ahead,
sir. Chief Weston is at his desk.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick heard, meantime, the tramp of men through a
corridor adjoining the opposite side of the outer office,
and he knew that Chief Weston had immediately dismissed
them, to receive him in private.</p>

<p>“So, so; the business is important,” he rightly conjectured.</p>

<p>The door closed behind Nick of itself, but the snap of
the catch-lock hung fire until after the hearty voice of
the Boston chief of detectives, as he arose and gripped
Nick by the hand, had sounded through the room.</p>

<p>“How are you, Nick?” he cried cordially. “I’m a
thousand times more than glad to see you, Carter, on
my word.”</p>

<p>“Same to you, Weston,” laughed Nick. “Some time
has passed since we met.”</p>

<p>“Too long a time, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too.”</p>

<p>“Have a chair.”</p>

<p>Now the catch-lock snapped lightly.</p>

<p>A finger between the door and the jamb had been
withdrawn.</p>

<p>A reddish head drew away from the panel, a pair of
ears ceased their strained attention, a light step retreated
through the passage, and two narrow gray eyes like
those of a cat indicated that their owner had now satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his inquisitive yearning, and learned the name of
the visitor who so peremptorily had issued his commands.</p>

<p>As Nick accepted a chair near that taken by Weston
at his desk, he carelessly jerked his thumb toward the
door by which he had entered.</p>

<p>“Where’d you get him, Weston?” he asked dryly.</p>

<p>“Get whom?” queried the chief, with inquiring eyes.</p>

<p>“The clerk.”</p>

<p>“Hyde—the one who announced you?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>“Oh, he’s been at work on the books out there for
about a year. He’s only an assistant clerk.”</p>

<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p>“Why did you ask?”</p>

<p>“For no reason.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! You must have had some reason, Nick.”</p>

<p>“None of consequence,” smiled Nick. “I asked about
him, in fact, only because I had to fairly drive him in
here when I declined to send in a card or mention my
name.”</p>

<p>Chief Weston threw back his head and laughed.</p>

<p>“That’s easily explained,” said he, still chuckling. “I
growl at him roundly at regular intervals, Nick, for annoying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
me with visitors whom I neither know nor wish
to see. I am getting him by degrees, however, so that
he requires the whole pedigree of a caller before announcing
him, which is about as bad a fault, I imagine.
Sandy is all right, though, in his own peculiar way.”</p>

<p>“Sandy, eh? That’s a nickname, I take it, because of
his red hair?”</p>

<p>“No, not exactly. His name is Sanderson Hyde.”</p>

<p>“Ah, just so.”</p>

<p>“I took him in to oblige a journalist friend,” added
Weston, smiling. “It’s always well to stand ace-high
with the press, you know.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too,” nodded Nick, now willing to digress.
“You sent for me to come over here from New
York, Weston. What do you want of me?”</p>

<p>“You got my wire?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“Did Chick come with you?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Nick, at this reference to his chief assistant.
“I came over alone.”</p>

<p>“Are you busy in New York just now?”</p>

<p>“I’m always busy, Weston.”</p>

<p>“Too busy to undertake a little work for me?”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In and about Boston.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span></p>

<p>“What’s the nature of it?”</p>

<p>“There is nothing in giving you all of the details,
Nick, unless you are in a position to accept an offer and
help me out,” Chief Weston gravely rejoined. “First
of all, Nick, may I count on you?”</p>

<p>The brows of the celebrated New York detective knit
a little closer over his keen gray eyes. He drew up a
bit in his chair, remarking gravely:</p>

<p>“Your business is important, Weston, or you would
not have sent for me.”</p>

<p>“Very important.”</p>

<p>“A serious matter?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly.”</p>

<p>“Have your own men tackled it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the very best of them.”</p>

<p>“With no results?”</p>

<p>“None but absolute failure.”</p>

<p>“Are they now at work on the case?”</p>

<p>“Some of them.”</p>

<p>“And you wish me to take a hand in the work?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“If I consent to do so, Weston, I shall impose one
condition,” said Nick decidedly.</p>

<p>“I expect it.”</p>

<p>“You do?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>

<p>“Certainly,” nodded the chief. “Am I not familiar
with your methods? You will require me to order all
of my men off the case and give it entirely to you.”</p>

<p>“That’s the condition,” said Nick bluntly.</p>

<p>“I will accept it.”</p>

<p>“And leave the matter to me alone?”</p>

<p>“Precisely. In no way whatever shall you be interfered
with.”</p>

<p>“Very good.”</p>

<p>“You will undertake the work for me?”</p>

<p>“I will hear of what it consists,” replied Nick, with
his curiosity stirred. “If it is all that your remarks
imply—well, Weston, you may then count on me to give
it an argument.”</p>

<p>“Capital.”</p>

<p>“Now, cut loose and give me the facts of the case.”</p>

<p>Chief Weston opened a drawer of his desk and took
out a batch of papers and documents, among which was
a neatly mounted photograph about five inches square,
such as may be taken with a small portable camera, or
a kodak.</p>

<p>While he placed the papers on his desk, he handed
the photograph to Nick Carter, saying impressively:</p>

<p>“First examine this, Nick, and tell me what you make
of it.”</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.
<br />
<small>MODERN HIGHWAYMEN.</small></h2>


<p>While the Boston chief sat silently regarding him,
Nick Carter studied the photograph attentively for several
moments.</p>

<p>“H’m!” he presently grunted. “The picture is quite
plain. Two automobiles appear to have met in a lonely
woodland road.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Only part of one of them is visible in the picture,”
continued Nick, commenting upon the various details.
“The picture was evidently taken by an occupant of one
of the cars.”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“In the road near the other machine stands a very
tall woman, closely veiled, who is pointing a revolver,
evidently at the occupants of the other car.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“They are not visible in the picture, however, except
the extended hand of one of them, obviously the hand
of a woman. She is passing a purse, two watches, and
what appears to be several pieces of jewelry, to a masked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
man, who is standing near the woman holding the leveled
revolver.”</p>

<p>“Those are the main features of the picture, Nick,”
nodded Weston. “Now, what do you make of it?”</p>

<p>Nick glanced up and replied:</p>

<p>“It looks to me like a hold-up.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what it was.”</p>

<p>“When and where?”</p>

<p>“Near the Brookline suburb, about a week ago.”</p>

<p>“Is this the case on which you wish to employ me?”</p>

<p>“One of them.”</p>

<p>“There are others?”</p>

<p>“Fifty, Nick, within the past two months.”</p>

<p>“Whew!” whistled Nick, with brows lifting. “I have
read in the newspapers that you have had numerous
highway robberies about here, but I did not imagine them
to be so frequent as you state.”</p>

<p>“Because only a small part of them have been given
publicity,” replied Weston. “I have suppressed many,
Nick, in the hope of thereby getting some traceable clue
to the crooks.”</p>

<p>“Yet you are all still in the dark?”</p>

<p>“Never more so, Nick,” was the grave rejoinder. “In
the past two months there have been, as I have stated,
upward of fifty of these highway robberies.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>“Early and often, eh?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly so. These hold-ups have been committed,
moreover, with a boldness and daring that invests them
with a peculiarly mysterious character. Whether they
are the work of two or three professional crooks, or that
of a larger organized gang of them, is hard to say. At
all events, Nick, we have been absolutely unable to get
any traceable clue to the identity, haunts, or headquarters
of the rascals.”</p>

<p>“Have two of these hold-ups ever been committed at
precisely the same time?”</p>

<p>“Not that have been reported.”</p>

<p>“If that had occurred,” explained Nick, “it would indicate
that a considerable gang is at work.”</p>

<p>“Two hold-ups in one evening is the nearest approach
to it,” said Weston.</p>

<p>“In the same locality?”</p>

<p>“Within a mile of one another.”</p>

<p>“Were the crooks in an automobile?”</p>

<p>“Yes, in both cases.”</p>

<p>“Then both jobs may have been done by the same
persons.”</p>

<p>“I feel quite sure of that, Nick, for the same description
of the thieves and their automobile was given
me by the victims of both outrages.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do these crooks always work from an automobile?”</p>

<p>“In the majority of the cases reported,” bowed Weston.
“Yet at times they have appeared on horseback,
and on several occasions afoot. The work, Nick, is that
of two or more men and a woman, as nearly as I can
judge, and all of them are possessed of extraordinary
nerve, boldness, and sagacity. They have committed
these crimes at all hours of the day and night, frequently
in quite public places, yet they have thus far
completely evaded detection and pursuit. They invariably
do their rascally job with a decisiveness and despatch
that completely awe their victims, who are usually
so alarmed——”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” said Nick quite abruptly. “I’d like
to ask you a few questions, Weston.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“If I decide to look into this case, I shall then have
some few points already settled, and will need to waste
no time in seeking the information myself.”</p>

<p>“Exactly,” nodded the chief. “What do you wish to
know?”</p>

<p>“First, about the crooks themselves,” said Nick. “What
have you in the way of descriptions of them?”</p>

<p>Chief Weston laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>“A variety, Nick, to fit any type of man except a
humpback or one dismembered,” he replied.</p>

<p>“The descriptions vary, eh?”</p>

<p>“I should say so.”</p>

<p>“Possibly the robbers use a different disguise for each
job.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“Or, as nearly always is the case,” said Nick, “the
victims of the robbers were so frightened or excited at
the time that they retain only vague and exaggerated impressions
of their assailants.”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“To illustrate that,” added Nick, “I know of a case of
a noted prize-fighter, who was held up and robbed of
his watch and money in broad daylight, and within fifty
yards of Central Park. He declared that the thief was
six feet tall, weighed one hundred and eighty pounds,
and was backed by two confederates, whom he could not
quite recall. We got the crook next day.”</p>

<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>“He was under five feet, weighed one hundred and
thirty pounds, and did the job entirely alone.”</p>

<p>“Quite a difference!” exclaimed Weston, laughing
heartily.</p>

<p>“Rather,” smiled Nick. “As a matter of fact, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
prize-fighter was so scared when he saw a revolver
thrust under his nose that the crook loomed as big as a
house. Probably thinking that such a job would not
be attempted single-handed, he afterward got it into his
head that he saw the two confederates, and was so
thoroughly convinced of the imaginary fact that he really
believed it. I could cite numerous similar cases.”</p>

<p>“So could I, Nick.”</p>

<p>“Descriptions are not at all reliable, as you imply, yet
they sometimes help one a little.”</p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>“In a general way, then, you think there are at least
two men and one woman in this gang?”</p>

<p>“The cases reported convince me of that,” bowed
Weston. “That picture shows the woman, moreover,
though two men are mentioned in the majority of robberies
reported.”</p>

<p>“Are the men always masked?”</p>

<p>“No, not always. The woman is invariably veiled,
however, and the descriptions of the men indicate a frequent
change of disguise.”</p>

<p>“That is to be expected,” said Nick. “Now, about
the automobile used by the knaves. Have any attempts
been made to follow it or to trace it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>“Repeated attempts, Nick, all of which have proved
futile.”</p>

<p>“Has none of the victims been able to report its registered
number?”</p>

<p>“We have had a dozen different numbers reported,”
replied Chief Weston; “but investigation showed that
all of them were fictitious.”</p>

<p>“Yet the crooks might be located, chief, if the make
of the automobile were known,” suggested Nick. “That
should have been easily learned by some of these people.”</p>

<p>Chief Weston shook his head.</p>

<p>“That would be true, Nick, providing the scamps always
used the same machine,” said he. “Half a score of
different automobiles have been reported as having been
used by these knaves at the time of the numerous hold-ups.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Nick, with a shrug of his broad shoulders.
“Evidently, then, these crooks have considerable
money invested in their rascally enterprise.”</p>

<p>“It certainly appears so.”</p>

<p>“How about the horses ridden by them?” Nick next
inquired. “Can the owner of none of them be discovered?”</p>

<p>“In the few cases in which persons have been held up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
by a horseman,” replied Weston, “the highwayman has
usually been alone. According to the description given,
moreover, he has as many horses as automobiles, for he
has appeared on grays, bays, blacks, and sorrels.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed at the glibness with which the last was
said.</p>

<p>“It seems a bit odd to me, Weston, that none of your
men have been able to get on the track of these desperadoes,”
he presently rejoined. “It is not often that
a gang of highwaymen can long escape detection and
arrest, when at work in and about a city like Boston.”</p>

<p>“They are not ordinary knaves, Nick,” emphatically
declared Chief Weston. “If they were, we should have
landed them long ago.”</p>

<p>“Where do these robberies usually occur?”</p>

<p>“Generally in some lonely part of a suburban road,
though several have taken place in the evening, right
in the heart of Brookline, Cambridge, and Newton,”
replied Weston. “It is evident that the crooks select
their victims from the more wealthy suburbs, presumably
with a view to obtaining the more plunder.”</p>

<p>“How do they usually proceed?”</p>

<p>“In various ways, Nick, according to my reports. At
times they block the road with their car and hold up
the first automobile-party that appears, which, of course,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
is obliged to stop. Having relieved the travelers of their
property, the crooks then forced them to turn their machine
about, under the muzzles of leveled revolvers, and
depart at full speed. If the frightened victims return in
a few moments, as once or twice has been the case, they
reach the scene, only to find that the knaves have fled.”</p>

<p>“Naturally,” said Nick smilingly.</p>

<p>“They have adopted, in fact, innumerable methods for
holding up an automobile-party,” added Weston, “and
they invariably intimidate their quarry and get away
with the goods.”</p>

<p>“Of what does their plunder usually consist?” inquired
Nick.</p>

<p>“Money and jewelry. They take all that their victims
have, and the most of them give up readily rather
than take any chances of being shot in cold blood.”</p>

<p>“Have you been able to locate any of the stolen property
in the pawn-shops?”</p>

<p>“Not a piece of it.”</p>

<p>“Judging from your reports, Weston, what is the value
of the property thus far secured by these highwaymen?”</p>

<p>“Thousands of dollars, Nick. Close upon fifty thousand,
at least.”</p>

<p>“Have there been house burglaries about here of
late?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>“Very few.”</p>

<p>“It looks, then, as if these knaves were confining themselves
to this road work.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” bowed Weston.</p>

<p>Nick glanced again at the photograph, which he still
retained in his hand.</p>

<p>“This was one of these hold-ups, was it?” said he.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“It occurred in Brookline?”</p>

<p>“In a lonely road leading into Brookline,” replied
Weston. “The victims were Brookline people, and were
robbed of some five hundred dollars’ worth of diamonds
and jewelry, including what money they had with them.
The victims were two ladies, taking an afternoon ride in
a Stanley machine.”</p>

<p>“Did they have a chauffeur?”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“How was that?”</p>

<p>“One of the women, Mrs. Badger, is an expert driver,
and frequently rides without a chauffeur.”</p>

<p>Nick glanced again at the photograph—little dreaming
at that moment, however, how important a clue he
then held in his hand.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.
<br />
<small>NICK CARTER HELD UP.</small></h2>


<p>Despite that he then attached no special significance to
the photograph, the fact that Nick Carter was of a peculiarly
impressionable nature, and that any unusual circumstance
quickly stirred his rare detective instinct, appeared
in his next question and the abruptness with which
it was asked.</p>

<p>“How did it happen, Weston, that this picture of the
scene was taken during the robbery?”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” replied the Boston chief.</p>

<p>“One moment,” interposed Nick. “First, tell me something
about the victims of the robbery.”</p>

<p>“The Mrs. Badger mentioned,” replied Weston, “is the
wife of one Amos G. Badger, a wealthy Boston stock-broker.
He owns a fine old place on one of the most
desirable outskirts of Brookline, inherited from his father
some years ago, and the couple move in the most exclusive
circles of the local fashionable society. Badger’s
place is on Laurel Road, and covers several acres.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” nodded Nick; “I follow you.”</p>

<p>“Mrs. Badger’s companion that afternoon was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
sister,” continued Weston, “a woman locally famous under
the name of Madame Victoria.”</p>

<p>“Famous for what?” inquired Nick.</p>

<p>“Well, she claims to be an astrologer, a spiritual
medium, and a sort of fortune-teller, I believe,” explained
Chief Weston.</p>

<p>“H’m!”</p>

<p>“At all events, Nick, she does a tremendous business,
and has a magnificent suite in an office building on Tremont
Street, directly opposite the Common. No end of
wealthy and fashionable people consult her, either for
advice in business or love-affairs—or to get messages
alleged to come from dead friends,” added Weston,
laughing a bit derisively.</p>

<p>“I don’t take any stock in that stuff,” said Nick
bluntly.</p>

<p>“Nor do I, Nick,” was the reply. “Yet the woman is
certainly a character, and, if reports are true, has made
very many remarkable predictions, and displays a most
mysterious faculty for communicating with the unseen
world.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“Like you, Nick, I have no faith in any of that rot!”
laughed Weston. “Yet I know half a dozen brokers who
consult her regularly as to the course of the stock-market,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
as well as many other business men, all of
whom claim to derive great advantages thereby. Her
rooms are always occupied by some patron, either male
or female, and her fees are very high. So there may
be a little more in it, Nick, than you imagine.”</p>

<p>Nick shook his head incredulously.</p>

<p>“Come back to Hecuba,” he growled. “You say that
this woman is sister to Badger’s wife?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is her right name?”</p>

<p>“Victoria Clayton.”</p>

<p>“A euphonious name, at least.”</p>

<p>“Badger’s wife was a Claudia Clayton, and at one
time was on the stage,” continued Weston. “She, too,
is a remarkably clever and capable woman, an accomplished
linguist, a votary of physical culture, an expert
tennis and golf-player, and one of the best cross-country
riders among the cultured sporting set who lean to such
pastimes. Both women, in fact, are over the average,
and out of the ordinary.”</p>

<p>“Did Badger marry his wife from the stage?”</p>

<p>“I think not, Nick. She had retired some time before.
They have been married about five years, I believe.”</p>

<p>“Come back to the picture,” said Nick. “It must
have been taken just as the hold-up occurred.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>

<p>“Yes, it was.”</p>

<p>“Were the crooks aware of it?”</p>

<p>“No, indeed.”</p>

<p>“How was the trick pulled off?” demanded Nick curiously.
“It’s not often that such a clever dodge is played
upon professional crooks.”</p>

<p>“The woman who did it is clever, just as I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Tell me how it happened.”</p>

<p>“I will give you the facts as they were given to me.”</p>

<p>“By whom?”</p>

<p>“By Amos Badger and his wife,” replied Chief Weston.
“He notified me by telephone of the robbery, and
called here with his wife the next morning to report
the details of the hold-up. Two days later, as soon as
it could be finished and mounted, Badger brought me
the photograph.”</p>

<p>“What about the hold-up?”</p>

<p>“It was committed about a week ago, at three o’clock
in the afternoon,” said Weston. “Mrs. Badger and
her sister, Madame Victoria, were returning from Canton
to Brookline. When in a lonely section of a road
that leads through a considerable belt of woods, they
rounded a sharp curve and came suddenly upon a large
automobile standing at an angle across the road. A man
appeared to be fixing some break in the works, and was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
crouching beside it, while a woman stood near-by in the
road, apparently watching him.”</p>

<p>“Were they the only occupants of that car?”</p>

<p>“Yes, as the picture indicates. They were, too, the
only persons in sight in either direction.”</p>

<p>“The machine appears to be a Winton.”</p>

<p>“That’s what it was, Nick, for Mrs. Badger noticed
it.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” nodded Nick. “What more?”</p>

<p>“Naturally Mrs. Badger slowed down, nearly stopping,
for the road was almost completely blocked by the
other car,” continued Weston. “Then the veiled woman
seen in the picture suddenly stepped forward, leveled a
revolver, and commanded Mrs. Badger not to start her
auto without permission.”</p>

<p>“H’m!” exclaimed Nick. “That was bold, indeed.”</p>

<p>“At the same moment the man, who was seen to be
masked, sprang up and approached the two startled
women, and commanded them to hand over their jewelry
and money, and to be very lively about it.”</p>

<p>“Which they did?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Nick, for the women naturally were much
alarmed. Both hastened to obey, though Madame Victoria
did, I believe, undertake to make some argument<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
or protest. She was cut short, however, with a threat
that quickly silenced her.”</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>“She had on the seat of the car, however, a small
camera, which she frequently carries, one of her fads
being that of securing pretty views, of which she has
several large volumes. Looking down, she observed it,
and had the presence of mind to conceal it with her
hand, at the same time snapping it and luckily catching
the picture you have there. I told her it was a clever
piece of work, Nick, yet it is much to be regretted that
the faces of the crooks were covered. Otherwise, we
should possess a clue well worth having.”</p>

<p>“I believe your story,” assented Nick.</p>

<p>“The crooks, having secured their plunder, ordered
the women to drive on, which they were very willing to
do,” concluded Weston. “They were too frightened to
venture back in pursuit of the rascals, but hurried home,
to notify me by telephone.”</p>

<p>For some moments Nick had worn a decidedly
thoughtful expression, as if he already had some project
in his mind. Before the chief had fairly ceased speaking,
moreover, Nick said bluntly:</p>

<p>“I’d like to talk with Mrs. Badger.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>“By telephone?” inquired Weston, wondering at the
wish.</p>

<p>“No, personally.”</p>

<p>“You may easily do so by going out to Brookline.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go!” exclaimed Nick, abruptly rising. “I suppose
I may keep this photograph for a short time?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“As regards my undertaking to round up the rascals
guilty of these robberies—well, I will give you my answer
a little later,” Nick went on to say, as he opened
the door by which he had entered. “I have no doubt,
old friend, that it will be a favorable answer.”</p>

<p>“I hope so, Nick, I’m sure,” declared Weston, as he
followed the former into the outer office, where Nick
briefly halted.</p>

<p>Sanderson Hyde, perched upon a stool in the enclosure,
appeared busy over his books, not so much as looking up
at the intruders.</p>

<p>“Are you going out at once?” inquired Weston.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nick, slipping the photograph into his
pocket. “There are a few questions I wish to ask Mrs.
Amos Badger. If I can find a public automobile, Weston,
I think I will go out there in it. It’s the quickest
conveyance, and this is a fine morning for a ride.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find what you want at the corner below,” replied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
Weston. “The machine is all right, and so is the
man. Grady is his name. Mention mine, Nick, and
there’ll be no charges.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll see that Grady gets his fee, all right,” laughed
Nick, as he turned to leave the office. “I’ll see you later,
Weston, probably early this afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Do so,” nodded the latter.</p>

<p>Then he turned to the busy clerk and added, a bit
sharply:</p>

<p>“What did you say to that man, Hyde, when he came
in here this morning?”</p>

<p>Young Sanderson Hyde looked up with raised brows.</p>

<p>“Nothing of consequence, chief,” he respectfully answered.
“Only a few words about sending in his card.”</p>

<p>“Do you know the man?”</p>

<p>“No, sir. I don’t recall ever having seen him.”</p>

<p>“Well, the next time you see him take a good look at
him, for that man is Nick Carter, the greatest detective
that ever stood in leather.”</p>

<p>“The dickens!” gasped Hyde, with manifest astonishment.
“You don’t mean it, chief! Not Nick Carter
himself?”</p>

<p>“I always say what I mean,” growled Weston. “Hereafter,
show him into my office without delay.”</p>

<p>The catlike eyes followed the burly figure of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
speaker as he returned through the passage, and presently
the snap of the catch-lock sounded through the
office.</p>

<p>Then Mr. Hyde laid down his pen and came out of
the enclosure. His tread was more light and cautious
than ordinary business should have required. He glanced
sharply into both of the adjoining corridors, listened intently
for a moment, then darted into a telephone-closet
near-by and tightly closed the door.</p>

<p>Nick Carter found Grady on the corner mentioned, a
shrewd-looking young Irishman, seated in an excellent
runabout, reading the morning newspaper.</p>

<p>“Do you know Laurel Road, Brookline, Mr. Grady?”
asked Nick, halting beside the machine.</p>

<p>“I know pretty near where it is, sir,” said Grady, alert
for business. “I can find it for you, all right.”</p>

<p>“Take me out there,” said Nick, mounting to the seat.
“To the house of Mr. Amos Badger.”</p>

<p>“The broker, sir,” nodded Grady. “I know the man,
sir. I’ll land you out there in thirty minutes, sir, or
less, if you say the word.”</p>

<p>“I’m in no special hurry,” said Nick. “Keep down
to the speed limit.”</p>

<p>He did not tell Grady his name, nor that he came
from the police headquarters. Neither did he enter into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
much conversation with the man, for Nick was absorbed
in thought about the disclosures made him, and the various
possibilities of the work he was invited to undertake.</p>

<p>Grady, on his part, was not quite as good as his word.
He ran a mile or two out of the direct course to Laurel
Road, and then he had to round the great Chestnut Hill
reservoir in order to hit the right track.</p>

<p>There are numerous wooded roads on the outskirts of
fashionable Brookline, along which the attractive dwellings
are much scattered, or divided by extensive estates;
and through one of these roads Grady was sending his
machine at a faster clip, to make up for lost time.</p>

<p>Suddenly, from out a little piece of woods some fifty
yards away, a drunken fellow came staggering into the
road, much as if he had just awakened from a nap in
the shrubbery; and Nick Carter, being the first to see
him, said quickly to his driver:</p>

<p>“Look out for that chap, Grady.”</p>

<p>“I see him, sir,” nodded Grady.</p>

<p>“He has a load aboard.”</p>

<p>“I should say so.”</p>

<p>The intoxicated man now heard the automobile approaching
him from behind. He turned around, halting
unsteadily in the middle of the road, where he stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
swaying and staring as if too fuddled to know which side
of the road to seek to avoid being run over.</p>

<p>Grady naturally slowed down when scarcely twenty
feet from the fellow.</p>

<p>“Get out of the road!” he impatiently yelled. “Take
one side or the other, blast you!”</p>

<p>The auto had come to a dead stop.</p>

<p>The man in the road reeled a little to one side—and
a little nearer.</p>

<p>Then, with movements as quick and decisive as a lightning
stroke, he sprang forward, whipped out a brace of
revolvers, leveled them straight at the heads of the
two men in the auto, and sharply cried:</p>

<p>“Hands up! If you start that machine, driver, I’ll
blow your head off!”</p>

<p>The voice was as firm and cold as ice, yet it had a
ring as threatening as when blades of steel cross in
deadly combat.</p>

<p>Nick Carter fairly caught his breath.</p>

<p>“Held up, by thunder!” was his first thought.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.
<br />
<small>THE ESCAPE.</small></h2>


<p>How to get the best of the highwayman was Nick
Carter’s second thought.</p>

<p>This did not look to be easy, yet Nick’s hand instinctively
went toward his hip pocket.</p>

<p>“Stop! Hands up!”</p>

<p>The reiterated command fairly cut the air with its
threatening intensity.</p>

<p>Grady’s hands were already reaching after clouds.</p>

<p>Nick Carter’s now followed suit, and went into the
air.</p>

<p>In the voice, eyes, and attitude of the ruffian in the
road, there was that which convinced Nick that disobedience
and defiance would certainly invite a bullet.</p>

<p>He saw, moreover, that the aim of the scoundrel was
true to the mark, and that the finger on the trigger of
the weapon covering his own breast was already beginning
to contract, during the moment that he showed
signs of giving fight.</p>

<p>“If one of you move before I command it,” said the
highwayman, “I will instantly open fire upon you. And
I never miss my aim!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>The threat was as calmly made as if the speaker had
merely inquired the time of day, yet the voice did not
for a moment lose its terribly convincing ring.</p>

<p>Nick seized the opportunity to look him over, and he
felt comparatively sure that he was up against the same
man that appeared in the Badger photograph.</p>

<p>The fellow was roughly clad at this time, however,
with a soft felt hat drawn over his brows.</p>

<p>He was a well-built, athletic man, apparently somewhere
in the forties; yet he was as quick as a cat in his
movements, and evidently was endowed with supple
muscles and nerves of steel.</p>

<p>The rascal was heavily bearded, yet this did not figure
for much with Nick Carter. He rightly judged that the
man was carefully disguised, yet the make-up was so
cleverly prepared and adjusted that Nick, despite his
experience in such artifices, could not detect it.</p>

<p>What Nick chiefly noted, in fact, was that the eyes of
the man had in them the piercing gleam of deadly resolution,
a fixed and vicious determination to execute the
desperate deed that he had undertaken. There was no
sign of intoxication now, which plainly had been assumed
only for the purpose of holding up the travelers.</p>

<p>Though not lacking in courage, Nick Carter had his
share of wisdom and discretion. He saw at a glance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
that he was entirely helpless for the moment, at least,
and he had no idea of deliberately inviting a bullet.</p>

<p>Such stirring episodes occur in a very few moments,
and not thirty seconds had passed since the hold-up,
when the voice of the highwayman again cut sharply
upon the morning air.</p>

<p>“Chauffeur, you do what I command, or worse will be
yours,” he cried sternly. “Lower one of your hands and
remove your employer’s watch.”</p>

<p>Grady hesitated for the bare fraction of a second.</p>

<p>Nick saw the hand clutching one of the weapons begin
to contract.</p>

<p>“Obey him, Grady,” said he, with ominous curtness.</p>

<p>“Bedad, I don’t like——”</p>

<p>“One more second, and I’ll——”</p>

<p>“Obey him!” hissed Nick, with suppressed vehemence.
“Obey him, you idiot!”</p>

<p>Nick saw at a glance that that one more second would
have ended with Grady’s receiving an ounce of lead.</p>

<p>Grady had the true grit and pugnacious characteristics
of an Irishman, but he now dropped one hand and removed
Nick’s watch and chain.</p>

<p>The highwayman came a step nearer, until he stood
barely six feet away in the dusty road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>“Toss them to the ground at my feet,” he commanded,
with his evil eye fixed upon the chauffeur.</p>

<p>“Do so, Grady,” said Nick.</p>

<p>Grady obeyed with an ugly scowl, and the watch and
chain landed in the dust at the ruffian’s feet.</p>

<p>“Now, your employer’s purse.”</p>

<p>“In the breast pocket of my vest, Grady.”</p>

<p>“Look lively.”</p>

<p>Grady dove into Nick’s vest and drew out his pocketbook.</p>

<p>Nick still sat with his hands in the air, but not for a
moment did his eyes leave those of the highwayman.</p>

<p>Though at first inclined to send Grady into his hip
pocket after his revolver, Nick realized that the Irishman
might not be quick and accurate in using it, and
also that the crook was alert to their every move. The
hazard was too great to be taken, and Nick decided to
submit to the situation for the time being, and watch
for an opportunity to turn the tables on the rascal.</p>

<p>Grady drew out the pocketbook, which contained
about a hundred dollars and a few unimportant papers.</p>

<p>“Toss it into the road,” commanded the highwayman.</p>

<p>“Let it go, Grady,” said Nick.</p>

<p>“Your employer has more wisdom than you, Grady,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
said the crook, with a threatening sneer. “Obey at
once, or I’ll let daylight into you.”</p>

<p>Grady tossed the pocketbook after the watch and chain.</p>

<p>“Now, up with your hands again!”</p>

<p>“Bedad, mister, some day the boot’ll be on the other
leg,” snarled Grady, as he obeyed.</p>

<p>“It’ll not be to-day, Grady, take my word for that,”
retorted the ruffian.</p>

<p>“The day will come, nevertheless,” Nick Carter now
said, with ominous quietude.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?”</p>

<p>“I certainly do.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t.”</p>

<p>“That is because you do not know who I am,” said
Nick pointedly.</p>

<p>“I don’t care who you are.”</p>

<p>“You don’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“I certainly don’t.”</p>

<p>“You will change your mind later.”</p>

<p>The scene was a curious one, the two men in the runabout
seated with their hands high above their heads,
while the man in the road stood as coolly intimidating
them as if not the slightest danger existed for him,
either from them or the sudden approach of some intruders
upon the scene.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick had begun the conversation with the scamp in
the hope of catching him napping for an instant, or that
some person or another automobile might appear; but
neither of them seemed probable, for the woodland road
was deserted, and the highwayman did not for a second
relax his vigilance or lower his leveled weapons.</p>

<p>With Nick Carter’s last remark, however, the rascal’s
eyes took on an uglier gleam, and he evidently decided
that he had better not defer making his escape. That
he was clever in so doing, and foresaw that his victims
might possibly be armed, appeared in the way he accomplished
it.</p>

<p>With both men constantly under his eyes, he said
sternly:</p>

<p>“The slightest move by either of you will cost him
his life. I warn you that I shall instantly fire, not caution
you again; so keep that in mind, and be wise.”</p>

<p>Then he slipped one of his revolvers into his coat
pocket.</p>

<p>With the other weapon constantly covering his victims,
with his gaze never leaving them, he slowly
crouched down and groped over the ground till he had
secured the plunder lying there, which he also dropped
into his pocket.</p>

<p>Then he rose erect again, and drew his other weapon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick was mentally praying for an opportunity to get
just one shot at the knave when he resorted to flight.</p>

<p>The flight of the rascal, however, was as original and
unexpected as his every other move had been.</p>

<p>“Now, Grady,” said he, with threatening austerity,
“you do just what I tell you, neither more nor less.”</p>

<p>“Begorra! it looks as if I’d have to.”</p>

<p>“You bet you will!”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“You start that machine of yours slowly, and turn
it into the shrubbery at that side of the road.”</p>

<p>“How am I going to start it with me hands in the
air,” snarled Grady, who had really seen Nick’s desire to
delay matters.</p>

<p>The voice of the highwayman again took on that
vicious ring which had warned Nick not to oppose him
then and there.</p>

<p>“Don’t you speak again, Grady, or this gun will drown
the sound of your voice,” he cried quickly. “You start
that machine and turn it into the shrubbery—and don’t
forget, either of you, that I shall keep you constantly
covered. Start her up, Grady, and turn sharp out of
the road!”</p>

<p>With the ugliest kind of a scowl, Grady gripped the
steering-bar and slowly started the runabout, turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
toward the shrubbery that lined the road in that locality.</p>

<p>Just as the Irishman did so, however, there suddenly
sounded from up the road the warning toot of an automobile-horn.</p>

<p>“Steady!—not a move!” yelled the robber warningly.
“If you drop your hands, mister, I’ll fire!”</p>

<p>Nick could not then see the scoundrel, for he had
darted back of the runabout when Grady turned it from
the road.</p>

<p>Glancing quickly in the direction from which the horn
had sounded, however, Nick now beheld a large touring-car
come sweeping around a sharp curve of the road,
some thirty yards away.</p>

<p>It was driven by a man with a beard, who was the
one occupant of the car, and whose eyes and features
were almost entirely masked with a pair of huge dust-glasses.</p>

<p>Nick now thought he could see a favorable finish to
this unexpected hold-up, for the touring-car was approaching
at a high rate of speed, and the escape of the
thief appeared next to impossible.</p>

<p>Yet the latter, while reiterating his threatening commands,
only backed a few paces toward the middle of
the road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>The man in the approaching car evidently saw what
was going on, and he began to slow down.</p>

<p>The rear of the runabout was now toward the road,
with the machine half-hidden in the shrubbery.</p>

<p>“Stop her!” whispered Nick, not yet venturing to turn
about on the seat. “Stop her at once!”</p>

<p>He did not wish to go too far in from the road.</p>

<p>Grady felt that he was taking his life in his hand—yet
he promptly obeyed.</p>

<p>Instantly two sharp reports of a revolver rang out on
the morning air.</p>

<p>The reports were followed by others, nearly as loud,
occasioned by the bursting of the two rear tires of the
runabout.</p>

<p>The highwayman had sent a bullet through each
rubber tire, obviously bent upon partly disabling the
runabout and thus preventing pursuit.</p>

<p>Then, just as the huge touring-car arrived upon the
scene, the daring rascal darted back through the veil
of smoke from his weapons and leaped aboard the car.</p>

<p>“Let her go!” he yelled commandingly.</p>

<p>The driver instantly gave her full speed, and the car
swept on down the road with the velocity of an express-train.</p>

<p>Already upon his feet in the runabout, Nick Carter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
whipped out his revolver and fired twice at the occupants
of the departing car. His aim was ruined by
Grady, however, who excitedly began backing the runabout
into the road, and Nick’s bullets went wide of
their mark.</p>

<p>In ten seconds the touring-car was vanishing in a
cloud of dust around a distant curve of the road.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” roared Grady, thinking Nick was about
to alight in the road. “I’ll follow them divils, sir, tires
or no tires!”</p>

<p>“Follow nothing!” growled Nick, thrusting his revolver
back into his pocket. “You might as well try
to follow a streak of lightning.”</p>

<p>“Will you let that blackguard escape?”</p>

<p>“Let him escape!” exclaimed Nick derisively. “I
should say, Grady, that he has already escaped. You
could not overtake him with this machine if your life
depended upon it.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, that’s right, sir,” Grady now admitted, more
calmly. “Yet the man in that car may try to do the
rascal——”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” interrupted Nick, with a growl. “The driver
of that car was the robber’s confederate.”</p>

<p>“D’ye think so?”</p>

<p>“I know so, Grady,” declared Nick, now plainly seeing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
how the entire job, which had taken less than five minutes,
had been planned and executed.</p>

<p>“I suspected as much when the man slowed down only
enough to let the crook aboard,” added Nick. “His approach
was timed to a nicety. It’s odds that he was
watching the hold-up from beyond the curve of the road,
and that he knew just when the other wanted him to approach.”</p>

<p>“Bedad, sir, I reckon you’re right.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we have much the worse of it for the present,
Grady, and have been held up by two of the gang of
crooks now at work in these parts,” added Nick. “But
I will yet break even with them, I give you my word
for that.”</p>

<p>“Me tires——”</p>

<p>“I will see that you are paid for them,” interrupted
Nick, much to Grady’s satisfaction. “Can you run the
machine back to town as it is?”</p>

<p>“Sure, sir, I can.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t wish to return quite yet.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir.”</p>

<p>“Keep on, Grady, and take me to Badger’s house,”
Nick bruskly commanded. “Look lively, too! This
does settle it, Grady, as far as I am concerned.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>“What d’ye mean, sir?”</p>

<p>“I mean that I will land this gang of highway robbers,
every man and woman of them, or lose a leg in the
attempt,” cried Nick, with Chief Weston’s request then
in his mind. “That’s what I mean, Grady. Let her go
lively, my man, and head straight for Amos Badger’s
house.”</p>

<br />
<small>THE HOUSE IN LAUREL ROAD.</small></h2>


<p>The direction taken by Nick Carter and Grady to
reach Laurel Road and the house of Amos Badger was
the same as that in which the highwayman had fled with
his confederate in the touring-car.</p>

<p>Nick felt some little chagrin over thus having been
successfully held up and robbed, yet this feeling was
somewhat assuaged by the fact that he had obtained a
good look at the thief, and had a clear impression of
his general features.</p>

<p>Nick felt quite sure, despite the rascal’s disguise, that
he could identify him if they again met, or, at least,
recognize his peculiarly keen eyes and cutting voice.</p>

<p>Though it then gave him no surprise, the distance to
Laurel Road from, the scene of the hold-up was less than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
a quarter of a mile, and then about the same distance
to the place owned and occupied by Mr. Amos Badger.</p>

<p>The surroundings were about as stated by Chief
Weston.</p>

<p>The road ran through an extreme outskirt of the
town, and was for the most part shut in by woods,
cleared only here and there for building.</p>

<p>There were but three dwellings on this secluded road,
none of which was within view of Badger’s place, which
was less modern and much more extensive than the
others, as if it had been a family homestead for several
generations.</p>

<p>Nick surveyed the place with some interest as he approached
it.</p>

<p>The house was a large, wooden mansion, standing fully
fifty yards from the road. It had a broad veranda in
front and on one side, the latter terminating with a porte-cochère
at the side entrance of the house.</p>

<p>A gravel driveway between a double row of elms and
beeches led in from the road, passing the front and one
side of the house, then leading out to a large stable well
to the rear of the dwelling.</p>

<p>In addition to these there were several wooden outbuildings,
one of which was a long carriage-house adjoining
the stable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>The features mentioned, together with the broad estate
covered with garden plots and shade trees, with a background
of woods in the near distance, gave the entire
place a rural aspect not often seen so near a large and
thickly settled town.</p>

<p>As the runabout sped up the long driveway, Nick saw
a man cleaning a large automobile just beyond the porte-cochère;
but the vehicle bore no resemblance to the one
in which the crooks had fled, and the circumstance did
not then appeal to him with any special significance.</p>

<p>“Run round to the side entrance, Grady,” said he.
“I’ll ask that workman who’s at home.”</p>

<p>Grady nodded, and presently brought the runabout to
a stop under the porte-cochère.</p>

<p>Nick quickly sprang down and approached the man
at work near-by. Instead of making any inquiry concerning
the inmates of the house, however, Nick abruptly
demanded:</p>

<p>“Have you seen an automobile pass along Laurel Road,
my man?”</p>

<p>My man was one Jerry Conley, chauffeur, hostler, and
all-round workman out of doors for Mr. Amos Badger.
He was a short, stocky man, of about thirty years, with a
head nearly as round as a bullet. His face was smoothly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
shaven, and was lighted by a pair of as shifty, crafty
eyes as ever lighted a human countenance.</p>

<p>They came round with half a leer to meet those of the
detective, while the man arose from his work on the car.
Wiping his hands on his overalls, he indulged in a series
of jerky nods, steadily eying Nick all the while, then
deliberately inquired:</p>

<p>“What’s that you say?”</p>

<p>“I asked if you had seen an automobile pass along
Laurel Road,” replied Nick, not half-liking the fellow’s
looks.</p>

<p>“Aye, I have,” said Conley.</p>

<p>“Which way did it go?”</p>

<p>“Which one d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“Which one?” echoed Nick, sharply eying the fellow.
“I mean one that may have passed within five or ten
minutes.”</p>

<p>It was then less than ten minutes since the robbery.</p>

<p>“Oh, if that’s what you mean, mister, I haven’t seen
any,” Conley now vouchsafed, with a less steadfast
scrutiny of Nick’s countenance.</p>

<p>“You haven’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not to-day.”</p>

<p>“Did you think I meant last week?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t think at all, mister,” said Conley, stooping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
to pick up a bit of cotton waste from the ground. “I
only heard what you asked, and that was whether I’d seen
an automobile pass along Laurel Road. I’ve seen hundreds
of ’em, mister, but none this morning.”</p>

<p>“You should have known that I meant this morning.”</p>

<p>“So I would, mister, if you’d said this morning,”
Conley replied, with a leer. “I never know more’n I’m
paid for knowing.”</p>

<p>“See here, my man,” said Nick quite sternly. “If the
master you serve carries the same cut of jib as yourself,
it’s long odds that he——”</p>

<p>What more Nick would have said was abruptly withheld,
however, for his quick ear heard the side door of
the house opened, and then the fall of a man’s feet on
the veranda, followed by the inquiry:</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, Jerry?”</p>

<p>“None at all, sir,” replied Conley, turning with a grin
to his questioner. “Not unless this gentleman is looking
for trouble, which I reckon he isn’t.”</p>

<p>Nick had already turned to survey the first speaker,
whom he rightly conjectured might be Mr. Amos
Badger, despite that it was then an hour when a stock-broker
should have been busy at the market.</p>

<p>He stood near the rail of the veranda, an erect, well-built
man of forty, cleanly shaven, with dark hair and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
eyes, the latter lighting a rather attractive yet noticeably
strong and determined face.</p>

<p>He was in slippers, and wore a house-jacket of figured
woolen, while his neck was bandaged with several thicknesses
of red flannel, as if he was afflicted with a sore
throat or with a cold. This was further evinced by his
hoarse voice when addressing Conley, yet his gaze all the
while was fixed upon the detective.</p>

<p>Nick promptly took up the remark of the chauffeur,
saying, with a quiet laugh:</p>

<p>“No, I’m not specially looking for trouble. I have
had enough of it for one day.”</p>

<p>“Enough of trouble?” inquired Badger, with an air of
wonderment at Nick’s meaning.</p>

<p>“Quite enough, sir, and at considerable expense. I’m
out a valuable watch and chain also what money I had
on my person.”</p>

<p>“Not robbed?”</p>

<p>“That’s what,” nodded Nick. “Held up by the crooks
who are doing such rascally work in these parts. But
there’ll come a day of reckoning, sir, you may safely
wager your whole fortune on that.”</p>

<p>There stole into Badger’s dark eyes, which were
still fixed upon Nick’s face, a momentary gleam of resentment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>“What sent you here so quickly after being robbed?”
he asked, with sinister inflection. “Did you expect to
find the thieves in my house?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, not at all.”</p>

<p>“Or did you come to condole with me over a like
mishap, since misery likes company? The headquarters
of the police is, I should say, the proper place for you
to have hurriedly visited.”</p>

<p>“I have just come from there,” replied Nick, a bit
dryly.</p>

<p>“Ah, that is different.”</p>

<p>“I merely asked that man if he had seen an automobile
pass,” added Nick, now approaching the veranda-steps.
“As a matter of fact, sir, I was on my way to
this house when I was held up by the crooks. Is Mrs.
Badger at home this morning, or her husband?”</p>

<p>“Both are at home.”</p>

<p>“Ah, very good!” exclaimed Nick.</p>

<p>“I am Mr. Badger.”</p>

<p>“I would like a brief interview with you and your
wife.”</p>

<p>“Regarding what?”</p>

<p>“The recent robbery of which your wife was a victim.”</p>

<p>“Are you a reporter?”</p>

<p>“I am a detective.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>“From Pemberton Square?”</p>

<p>“From New York,” replied Nick. “Yet I have just
come from Chief Weston’s office, in Boston, and at his
request I shall undertake to run down the gang of thieves
who are at work in this section.”</p>

<p>Though a doubtful smile curled Badger’s thin, firm
lips at this confident announcement, he at once displayed
more cordiality when Nick stated his vocation.</p>

<p>“I hope that you may succeed, officer,” said he, with
the same husky voice. “Come into the house. From
New York, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Nick, entering. “You may wait for
me, Grady.”</p>

<p>“All right, sir,” cried Grady, from his seat in the runabout.</p>

<p>“What name, officer?” inquired Badger.</p>

<p>“My name is Carter.”</p>

<p>“Not Nick Carter?”</p>

<p>“The same.”</p>

<p>Badger appeared surprised, Nick observed, and his
eyes lighted. He quickly extended his hand, saying
heartily, in wheezy tones:</p>

<p>“Well, well, I’m glad to meet you, Detective Carter,
and to hear that you think of getting after these highwaymen.
I know you by reputation, sir, and I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
no doubt that you will accomplish more than is being
done by Weston’s pack of mongrels. Forsooth, if you
do not, you will accomplish very little.”</p>

<p>The last was said with a covert sneer that fell unpleasantly
on Nick’s ears. He decided, however, that Badger
was probably nettled by the failure of the Boston detectives
to recover the property of which his wife had
been robbed, and Nick thought no more of the matter
at that time.</p>

<p>As he followed the man into the attractively furnished
library, from the windows of which could be seen the
stable and driveway, Nick agreeably rejoined:</p>

<p>“I am told that not much progress is being made
against these road robbers?”</p>

<p>“None at all, Mr. Carter, that I can discover,” replied
Badger, with a scornful shrug of his shoulders. “Here
is my wife, sir. Claudia, this is Detective Carter, of
New York, sent out here by Chief Weston to inquire
about the robbery. My wife, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>In the light of what Chief Weston had told him
about her, Nick surveyed the woman with more than
cursory interest.</p>

<p>Though now but thirty, she still retained in face and
figure most of the beauty and freshness of youth. She
was dark, like her husband, and rather above medium<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
height, with a figure at once noticeable for its grace and
suppleness. She had clean-cut features, a firm mouth
and chin, with a square jaw that plainly indicated more
than ordinary womanly strength.</p>

<p>She met Nick with a lively flash of her dark eyes,
and said agreeably, as they shook hands:</p>

<p>“I am pleased to see you, Detective Carter. I do hope
you’ll excuse my husband’s appearance, however, for he
looks dreadfully with those red flannels around his neck.
A sore throat has confined him to the house several days,
and he insists that nothing but red flannel bandages will
cure——”</p>

<p>“Oh, never mind my looks, Claudia,” interrupted Badger
petulantly. “Mr. Carter can put up with my looks,
I’m sure, and probably he has more important business
than that of discussing the curative virtues of red flannel
bandages.”</p>

<p>“No apology is necessary, Mrs. Badger, I assure you,”
smiled Nick, as he accepted a chair. “I did have a little
business with you when I started for here this morning, but
I do not now regard it as important.”</p>

<p>“How is that?” inquired Badger, with a furtive gleam
of distrust in his watchful eyes.</p>

<p>“It has lost the element of importance,” laughed Nick.
“I did intend to question you closely as to the personal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
appearance of the rascals by whom you were robbed,
Mrs. Badger, but since I have now seen one of them
myself, I need make no inquiries. I have no doubt that
the rascal I encountered was the same by whom you
were robbed.”</p>

<p>“You don’t mean that you, too, have been robbed?”
exclaimed Claudia, with countenance reflecting profound
amazement.</p>

<p>“Exactly,” nodded Nick.</p>

<p>“When?”</p>

<p>“This morning.”</p>

<p>“On your way here?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! What are these suburban roads coming
to, Amos?” cried the woman, quite aghast. “It soon
will not be safe to venture even into one’s front yard.”</p>

<p>“I believe you,” said Badger, with a wheezy growl.
“I do hope, Mr. Carter, that you’ll accomplish something.
What do you intend doing toward rounding up
these scoundrels?”</p>

<p>Nick laughed and shook his head.</p>

<p>“That is a difficult question for me to answer at present,”
said he. “I must first discover some clue with
which to start, some thread that is strong enough to follow,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
and which possibly may lead to the identification
of the knaves and where they are located.”</p>

<p>“Have you any such clue at present?” inquired Mrs.
Badger, with a smile and glance well calculated to invite
a frank rejoinder.</p>

<p>“Not the slightest.”</p>

<p>“That’s too bad.”</p>

<p>“Stay,” added Nick, as if with an afterthought. “I
believe I have something that may prove of advantage.”</p>

<p>“Good enough!” exclaimed Badger, with eyes dilating
curiously. “Of what does it consist, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>Nick was then reaching into his breast pocket, and
did not observe the speaker’s quickened interest, which
had not been betrayed in his husky voice.</p>

<p>“A photograph,” he replied, producing it. “The one
taken by you, Mrs. Badger, at the time you were robbed.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you are mistaken about that, Detective Carter,”
Claudia quickly exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Mistaken?”</p>

<p>“I took no photograph, sir.”</p>

<p>“Yet——”</p>

<p>“It was taken by my sister, Miss Clayton,” interrupted
Mrs. Badger. “Dear me, I couldn’t have done it for
my life. I was so unnerved by the terrible episode and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
sight of the robber’s revolver that I had no power to see
or do anything except what he commanded.”</p>

<p>“Yet one of them was a woman,” smiled Nick.</p>

<p>“I admit that, sir, but she had a revolver, and the
mere sight of a weapon has always terrified me,” explained
Claudia, with a shudder.</p>

<p>“You were quite sure that she was a woman?” inquired
Nick.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“That it was not a man clad in woman’s apparel?”</p>

<p>“Oh, absolutely. Her voice would have convinced me
of her sex.”</p>

<p>“A voice may be assumed.”</p>

<p>“Yet I am positive that I am right.”</p>

<p>“She was thickly veiled, I understand?”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“Then you did not see her face?”</p>

<p>“I did not.”</p>

<p>“Her figure, as seen in the photograph, appears very tall—too
tall for a woman,” persisted Nick.</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Detective Carter, I am positive that she
was a woman, and not a man in female apparel,” declared
Mrs. Badger, with emphasis. “Not only her garments
and voice plainly prove it, but I also noticed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
hands. They were too slender, white, and well formed
for the hands of a man.”</p>

<p>Nick now laughed lightly, remarking, in bantering
tones, not then attributing any serious weight to his
words:</p>

<p>“That last, Mrs. Badger, is capital. Yet I must observe
that, for one too terrified at the time to say or do
anything but obey the commands of that brace of crooks,
you did note some quite delicate details. Small hands,
eh? Well, well, I think quite likely you are right.”</p>

<p>A wave of crimson had risen over Mrs. Badger’s face,
while on that of her husband a darker frown was settling.</p>

<p>“I only happened to notice the woman’s hands, Detective
Carter, merely because she held in one of them the
revolver by which I was so frightened, and from which
I scarcely could take my eyes. Naturally, then, I noticed
the hand that held it.”</p>

<p>Nick vaguely wondered why she had gone to the
trouble to make this explanation, for there seemed to him
to be no special occasion for it; and before he could
frame any reply, Badger huskily demanded, with sinister
curiosity:</p>

<p>“Why are you pressing such questions as these, Detective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Carter? I fail to see that they signify anything
very important.”</p>

<p>“It signifies considerable to me, Mr. Badger, this
question of sex,” replied Nick, with a quiet laugh.</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Because I shall be able to proceed much more intelligently,
sooner or later, if I know positively that this
gang of crooks consists only of men, one or more of
whom is masquerading at times as a woman.”</p>

<p>“There is something in that,” admitted Badger.</p>

<p>“Female highwaymen are not common in these days,”
added Nick pointedly; “and I find it hard to credit the
evidence presented in this photograph, despite your wife’s
very natural confidence in the reliability of her own eyes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t much wonder at it,” Badger now laughed indifferently.</p>

<p>“It is not at all material who took the photograph,”
Nick went on. “I understand that Miss Clayton has an
office in town. I think I will call upon her this morning,
in the hope that she may have seen something worthy
of note at the time of the robbery. Am I likely to find
her at this hour?”</p>

<p>“Yes, surely,” exclaimed Mrs. Badger, rising. “If you
will wait just one moment, Detective Carter, I will give
you her business-card.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>“You will then have no trouble in finding her rooms.”</p>

<p>Nick bowed, then arose and took his hat from the
table.</p>

<p>Both Badger and his wife accompanied him to the
door, the latter giving him the card mentioned, and the
former remarking, as Nick descended the steps and entered
the runabout:</p>

<p>“I hope you’ll inform me, Mr. Carter, if you get any
reliable clue to the identity of these rascals. If I can aid
you in any way, moreover, I beg that you will command
me.”</p>

<p>“Thank you,” returned Nick, nodding for Grady to
start the machine. “I will bear it in mind, Mr. Badger.”</p>

<p>As he rode down the driveway he read the card which
he still retained in his hand, but the name of Miss Clayton
did not appear upon it.</p>

<p>It was the card of—Madame Victoria.</p>

<p>It gave the street and number of her suite of rooms,
and announced that she was an astrologer, an impressionist,
and a spiritualist medium. It further stated that
she could tell one’s fortune from the cradle to the grave,
that she could be profitably consulted for information
concerning dead friends, lost articles, missing relatives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and heirs, or for advice in business matters, love-affairs,
and all things pertaining to one’s personal welfare.</p>

<p>Nick read the card twice with considerable interest.</p>

<p>“Quite a round of accomplishments!” he grimly said
to himself. “I wonder why she doesn’t locate the property
of which she was robbed. The woman is evidently
a charlatan, a pretender, who imposes upon credulous
and weak-minded fools to get their money.</p>

<p>“Madame Victoria, eh? Well, I will now give you a
call, madame, and possibly a call-down! I’ll wager I
take means to fool and expose you!”</p>

<p>Such was the trend of Nick’s thoughts after reading
Madame Victoria’s card, to whose rooms he next proceeded.</p>

<p>Without the slightest faith in this woman’s alleged
powers, however, Nick was approaching one of the most
strange and startling experiences of his checkered career.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.
<br />
<small>MADAME VICTORIA.</small></h2>


<p>It was nearly noon when Nick Carter, after dismissing
Grady, entered the handsome granite building on Tremont
Street in which the rooms of Madame Victoria
were located.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></p>

<p>In so far as her pretentions to foretelling the future
were concerned, as well as her other alleged powers, Nick
felt morally sure that the woman was a fraud. Yet he
decided to take no chances that she possibly had seen
him before, and would remember his face, and in the
corridor of the building he carefully adjusted a simple
but effective disguise.</p>

<p>In so doing, he had a double object, however; that of
first getting an insight into Madame Victoria’s business
and her alleged occult endowments, merely to satisfy
his own curiosity; and, second, that of afterward being
able to return and question her about the robbery without
her suspecting his first visit.</p>

<p>“I’ll have this much the best of her, at all events,” he
said to himself, while adjusting his disguise. “If she
is as clever as she claims to be, however, she should be
able to see right through it. Yet I wager that she does
nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>In the corridor of the second floor was a door bearing
Madame Victoria’s name in gilt letters, and Nick unceremoniously
entered.</p>

<p>He found himself in an elaborately furnished waiting-room,
with windows overlooking the Boston Common.
The carpet was velvet. The furniture was upholstered
with richly figured plush. There were fine lace draperies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
at the windows, and the walls were hung with choice
paintings, while various ornaments of one kind or another
added to the adornment of the place.</p>

<p>Nick decided that Chief Weston was correct in stating
that this woman did a lucrative business.</p>

<p>From a chair near the window a young girl quickly
arose, laying aside a novel, and Nick inquired if Madame
Victoria was in.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, but she is engaged just now,” said the girl.
“She will be at liberty in a few minutes, however.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wait,” said Nick tersely.</p>

<p>“Take a chair, sir. If you will give me your card,
sir, I will take it to Madame Victoria as soon as her
visitor leaves, and will learn whether she will give you
a sitting at this time. It is nearly her hour for lunch.”</p>

<p>Nick did not discuss the matter. He gave the girl a
card bearing a fictitious name, with several of which he
was always provided.</p>

<p>Presently a richly dressed, middle-aged woman
emerged from an inner room, drying her eyes with her
handkerchief. She hurriedly departed, however, after
viewing her hat and hair in the mirror.</p>

<p>“She must have heard from some dead one,” thought
Nick, with grim derisiveness. “Either that, or some infernal
calamity has been predicted for her. I’m blessed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
if I’m not a good bit curious to know what I shall get
in there. Maybe I shall get it in the neck.”</p>

<p>He had not long to wait, for the servant presently announced
that Madame Victoria would receive him in the
inner room.</p>

<p>Nick left his hat on the table, and entered.</p>

<p>At first sight the view within was startling.</p>

<p>The single window of the inner room was heavily
curtained with black, excluding every ray of daylight.
Above a small square table in the middle of the floor,
however, there burned two electric lights enveloped in
green globes, the rays from which shed a weird and uncanny
light throughout the room.</p>

<p>On the walls were hung numerous astrological charts,
a number of horoscopes of celebrated men, more accurately
cast after death than before; and along with
these were various devices and insignia, of the meaning
and object of which Nick was entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>On a stand near the table were several packs of playing-cards,
presumably for fortune-telling, if no other
amusement.</p>

<p>In other respects the room was well furnished, with a
book-case against one wall, a couch opposite, and several
small but expensive chairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span></p>

<p>What chiefly startled Nick, however, was less this
curious appearance of the room than that of its solitary
inmate.</p>

<p>Madame Victoria was seated at the table, a woman
under thirty, large of figure, without being corpulent,
an attractive, self-reliant face, and an abundance of
brownish-red hair done up in picturesque disorder. She
was clad in a long purple robe, figured with small silver
stars, along with a crescent moon here and there among
them, the whole conveying a vague suggestion of a midnight
sky. The garment was voluminous, entirely covering
her waist and skirts.</p>

<p>From the large, loose sleeves, and in vivid contrast
with the rich dark-purple, protruded a pair of shapely
bare arms and hands; yet both these and the woman’s
face, uplifted when Nick entered, were lent a disagreeable,
deathlike pallor by the green light of the room.</p>

<p>Her first glance was at Nick’s left hand, at a valuable
carbuncle ring on the third finger, and then her eyes
rose up to his face while she abruptly exclaimed, with a
curious mingling of vivacity and surprise:</p>

<p>“Dear me! Oh, dear me, what a strange feeling, Mr.
Sibley. I feel just as if two men had entered this room.”</p>

<p>Nick was a bit startled.</p>

<p>Sibley was the name on the card he had sent in, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the woman’s immediate remark, in the light of Nick’s
disguise, was at least a little peculiar.</p>

<p>“Two men, eh?” said Nick inquiringly. “Well, I am
quite alone, madame, I assure you.”</p>

<p>Madame Victoria struck her brow violently with her
palm several times, then shook her head, as if bent upon
shaking out some of its ideas, and finally cried, with
obvious perplexity:</p>

<p>“Well, well, this is quite extraordinary. I never had
such a strange feeling. I am impressed exactly as if
two men had entered the room.”</p>

<p>“Impressed?”</p>

<p>“Take a chair, sir,” smiled Madame Victoria quite
graciously. “You must understand, Mr. Sibley, that I am
what I call an impressionist.”</p>

<p>“I hear and know the meaning of the word,” laughed
Nick, with curiosity still further piqued, “yet I cannot say
that I fully understand.”</p>

<p>Madame Victoria shrugged her fine shoulders, and regarded
him archly from under her lifted brows.</p>

<p>“Ah, well, that is not to be wondered at, Mr. Sibley,”
she replied agreeably. “Very few people understand
the true nature and source of their own impressions,
to say nothing of those of another.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>“That is quite true, madame,” assented Nick, bowing.</p>

<p>“In fact, sir, I cannot say that I understand even my
own,” added the woman, with a pretty display of frankness.
“They are so vivid at times, yet frequently seem
so utterly improbable, that I often shrink from expressing
them. I should have felt so in this case, Mr. Sibley,
and I doubt if I should have said what I did, sir,
had it not come from me quite involuntarily, and before
I could repress it. Of course, sir, I see that you
are entirely alone.”</p>

<p>“You interest me,” smiled Nick, bent upon leading her
on. “May I ask of what your present impressions consist?”</p>

<p>Madame Victoria drew forward in her chair, and
rested her pretty arms upon the table. Her face became
grave again, and once more her eyes briefly lingered upon
the ring on Nick’s finger, yet in an absent way that did
not attract his attention.</p>

<p>After a few moments, during which she appeared to
be yielding to some outside influence, she looked up at
him and said:</p>

<p>“There is something about you, sir, that I really cannot
explain. I cannot get rid of this impression of a
double personality here. I will try to fathom it, Mr.
Sibley, if you will be patient.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>“Take your time, madame,” said Nick, smiling at her
across the table.</p>

<p>Madame Victoria nodded and laughed, displaying her
white teeth and calling up a charming dimple in each
velvety cheek.</p>

<p>“As you probably know, Mr. Sibley,” said she, “people
come here for various objects. Some call to have
their horoscopes cast, others to have a mediumistic sitting
with me in the hope of receiving communications
from dead friends, while others call to consult me about
business and love-affairs, or to have their fortunes told
by the cards.”</p>

<p>“So I imagined,” bowed Nick.</p>

<p>“But you came for nothing of the kind, that’s my impression,”
exclaimed Madame Victoria, with an abrupt
exhibition of earnestness.</p>

<p>“It is quite correct.”</p>

<p>“You have no faith in any of those things.”</p>

<p>“That also is true.”</p>

<p>“Dear me, I am awfully perplexed,” laughed the
woman, apparently with vain efforts to straighten out
something in her mind. “You seem to me just like two
men, which I, of course, know is absurd. Yet I cannot
rid myself of the effects of that impression. I shall try<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
to do all that I can for you, however, and will give you
what comes to me.”</p>

<p>“If you please, madame,” said Nick, not a little impressed
and puzzled by her curious statements and apparently
genuine endeavors.</p>

<p>Again Madame Victoria beat her brow with her palm,
so violently that Nick did not wonder that her hair was
somewhat disordered.</p>

<p>As she suddenly fixed her eyes upon him, he noticed
that they began to dilate and glow with almost preternatural
brilliancy, while she abruptly exclaimed, as if
under the impulse of another of her vivid impressions:</p>

<p>“You have recently been in danger, Mr. Sibley, in
great danger!”</p>

<p>“Is that your present impression?” inquired Nick.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. It must be correct, too, or I could not feel
it so strongly.”</p>

<p>“Go on, madame.”</p>

<p>“You are a man who encounters many dangers,” Madame
Victoria continued, now speaking much more rapidly
and earnestly. “Your life is made up of stirring adventures
and frequent perils.”</p>

<p>“That is very true,” admitted Nick.</p>

<p>“I see you hunting—hunting—hunting!” cried the
woman, with suppressed vehemence. “I don’t know what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
it means, sir, but you seem to be constantly hunting,
searching after persons and things, and delving into all
kinds of complicated mysteries.”</p>

<p>“Well, well! that hits pretty near the mark,” laughed
Nick.</p>

<p>“Oh, dear! and I see you all surrounded with a red
atmosphere, as if you were not a stranger to violent
combats and the sight of blood.”</p>

<p>“I have seen my share of both.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, that is plain to me, very plain,” she rapidly
went on. “You are a busy man, and you—wait! I am
now carried away from here. I feel as if I were riding
in a railway-train. I don’t quite interpret the impression
as yet, but I feel—oh, now I have it! You don’t belong
here, sir, not in this city. You are a stranger here.”</p>

<p>“Well, not exactly that,” replied Nick, more and more
puzzled by the accuracy with which she was hitting the
mark.</p>

<p>“I don’t mean that you never were here, and are not
familiar with this city,” cried Madame Victoria quickly.
“I mean only that your business is not here, that your
interests are in some distant place. Isn’t that right?”</p>

<p>“Nearly so.”</p>

<p>“I knew it was.”</p>

<p>“How did you know it?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span></p>

<p>“Because of my impression, that of being carried away
in the cars,” explained the woman. “I presumably get
it from you, sir, for I am susceptible to all of the conditions
surrounding those who come here to consult me.”</p>

<p>“That is quite mysterious.”</p>

<p>“So many think.”</p>

<p>“How do you explain it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t explain it. I know only that it is so.”</p>

<p>“Yet——”</p>

<p>“One moment, please!” exclaimed Madame Victoria,
again leaning nearer. “You have recently lost something,
Mr. Sibley.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“Can you direct me how to find it?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Am I right?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“I cannot tell what it is, yet—yet I feel that you miss
something usually carried on your person.”</p>

<p>“That is true.”</p>

<p>“No, I cannot direct you how to find it—at least,
not at present. It is not still, not located yet. It is
moving—moving—moving. I see smoke and hear guns.
I feel the same impression as a moment ago—that you
have lately been in danger.”</p>

<p>Again she was speaking with that rapid, vehement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
earnestness as before, as if every sensitive string of her
delicate organism had been suddenly struck, thrilling her
with new and strangely correct impressions.</p>

<p>Nick Carter sat watching her as a cat watches a
mouse, but he could detect no sign of simulation or
treachery. Her voice, looks, actions, and constantly
changing moods all appeared to be perfectly genuine.</p>

<p>“I admit that I recently have been in danger,” said
he, in reply to her last remark.</p>

<p>Madame Victoria bowed over the table, again fixing
her eyes upon him with that strangely intensified stare.</p>

<p>“There are greater dangers before you,” she rapidly
declared.</p>

<p>“Is that so?” inquired Nick, wondering what was
now coming.</p>

<p>“Much greater dangers.”</p>

<p>“Of what kind?”</p>

<p>“Many kinds.”</p>

<p>“A general assortment, eh?”</p>

<p>“You regard them lightly, but I judge that to be
like you.”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“If you do so at this time, Mr. Sibley, you will do
wrong.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>“The perils threatening you cannot be wisely ignored.
I am impressed with a conviction that your life is imperiled
by——Stop a moment!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>Again Madame Victoria beat her brow, shaking her
head violently, apparently striving to get a clear interpretation
of her impressions.</p>

<p>“Ah, I have it!” she suddenly cried. “You are in
Boston on business—perilous business.”</p>

<p>“Well?” queried Nick, determined to tell her nothing.</p>

<p>“You came to me for advice?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then I advise you to drop it.”</p>

<p>“Drop what?”</p>

<p>“This perilous business.”</p>

<p>“Do you know of what it consists?”</p>

<p>“I do not get any impression of that,” replied Madame
Victoria, with curious nervous efforts to make her mind
receptive to the information desired, efforts that brought
the perspiration to her neck and brow in tiny drops.</p>

<p>“No, no. I do not get it—cannot get it,” she presently
added, with a gasp. “I have no idea of what it consists.
Yet I advise you to drop it.”</p>

<p>“Because of the dangers it involves?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>“They will not deter me,” said Nick, with a headshake.
“I never run from danger.”</p>

<p>“There is yet another reason.”</p>

<p>“For dropping the business?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“You will fail.”</p>

<p>“Fail in my undertaking?”</p>

<p>“That is my impression. Ah, I see you smile!” cried
the woman, wiping her damp cheeks and brow. “You
do wrong to deride and ignore my predictions. Ask
others to whom I have given advice. I have never yet
erred in one of these predictions. Take my advice, Mr.
Sibley, and avoid the impending perils.”</p>

<p>Nick had smiled incredulously, and arose to go. He
saw that the woman had no more to tell him, nor had
he any inclination to hear more in the same line.</p>

<p>Having paid her fee in money obtained by cashing a
check in order to settle with Grady for the damage to
his runabout, Nick bade Madame Victoria good morning,
and departed.</p>

<p>At the door of the inner room the woman tendered
him her hand, which he gravely accepted, noting at the
same time that it was damp with perspiration, yet as
cold as a hand of clay.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.
<br />
<small>THE DEEPER MYSTERY.</small></h2>


<p>Nick Carter was puzzled.</p>

<p>His interview with Madame Victoria had, in a way,
left him on the rocks.</p>

<p>He could not account for the knowledge which, in indirect
and equivocal terms, she had displayed. It plainly
indicated that she had from some source received information
concerning him and his business designs, as
well as about the losses he had suffered in his encounter
with the highwayman.</p>

<p>Had this information really been derived through the
occult powers of which the woman claimed to be possessed?</p>

<p>Nick Carter was not ready to believe that it had, for
he had but little faith in the supernatural.</p>

<p>On the other hand, any natural explanation seemed
equally difficult.</p>

<p>“My intended visit to her rooms was known to only
three persons by whom she could have been informed,
and they were Badger and his wife, and Grady,” Nick
perplexedly reasoned. “I know positively that Grady
did not inform her. Assuming even that the Badgers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
did so by communicating with her by telephone, they
cannot possibly have guessed that I would call upon her
in disguise. My make-up, together with the fictitious
name I gave, certainly should have blinded her to my
identity. Yet I do not believe she could have guessed,
merely by chance, all of the facts that she imparted, and
I’m blessed if I can quite fathom the mystery.”</p>

<p>The more Nick thought about it the more positive he
became that there existed some crooked work under
the surface, and this made him even the more determined
to ferret out what it was.</p>

<p>“I’ll telegraph to Chick and Patsy to come here,” he
abruptly decided, as he returned to the Adams House, at
which he had registered. “I shall need them to assist
me in locating these road robbers, whom I am now fully
resolved to run down. After sending a message to
Chick I will have another bout with the fortune-teller.
I’m blessed if I’ll let her throw me down in this fashion—not
and keep me down!”</p>

<p>It was but a short walk to the hotel, and there Nick
sent a telegram to Chick Carter, his chief assistant, ordering
him and Patsy, one of his younger detectives, to
come to Boston by the first train and join him at the
Adams House.</p>

<p>Nick knew that both would arrive late that evening,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
and before then he hoped to have solved that portion
of the mystery relating to the Tremont Street fortune-teller.</p>

<p>After spending half an hour at lunch, Nick went up
to his room and examined his disguise, which he had
not removed.</p>

<p>“It is perfect in every detail,” he mentally declared,
while surveying himself in the mirror. “She cannot
possibly have detected the make-up, and there must be
some other explanation of her insinuations. I’ll take it
off and visit her this time in proper person.”</p>

<p>While removing the disguise, Nick noticed the carbuncle
ring on his finger, and he immediately took it
off and slipped it into the pocket of another suit he was
then about putting on.</p>

<p>“I’ll have nothing about me that she may have seen
this morning,” he said to himself. “There’s a deal of
crafty keenness in those bright eyes of hers, and I’ll
make sure that she discovers nothing to identify me
with her visitor by the name of Sibley. If she succeeds
in doing that, the witch, there will be something more
than natural in it—or some sort of rascally cunning at
work under the surface. I’ll wager that she will have
no impression of two men entering her room this time,
nor that I was there this morning.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>Fashionably clad, with his strong, attractive face inviting
observation, Nick appeared for the second time at
the rooms of Madame Victoria, just about an hour after
leaving them.</p>

<p>The girl in the waiting-room did not recognize him,
and Nick took even the precaution to vary his voice
several degrees from that he had previously used.</p>

<p>“Is Madame Victoria disengaged?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“She is, sir, just at present,” said the girl.</p>

<p>“My card,” said Nick tersely. “I would like a business
interview with her.”</p>

<p>“One moment, sir.”</p>

<p>The girl vanished into the inner room, then returned
without the card.</p>

<p>“Madame will receive you, Mr. Carter,” she said,
bowing.</p>

<p>Nick left his hat as before, and approached the inner
room.</p>

<p>His recollections of it were not agreeable. The close
atmosphere, the green light, the walls hung with mystical
insignia, the purple-robed woman who had so baffled
his usual keen reasoning, and the touch of whose hand
lingered with him as when a person has touched the
hand of a corpse—all had left upon him a disagreeable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
impression, as when one has meddled with things pertaining
to the black arts.</p>

<p>He found Madame Victoria seated at the table, as before,
looking more like a sorceress to him than ever, as
he stepped gravely over the threshold.</p>

<p>The woman looked up from the card between her
thumb and fingers, and Nick thought he detected a
subtle light leap up from the depths of her brilliant eyes.
It vanished so quickly that he could not feel sure of it,
however, despite that he was now alert for the slightest
betrayal that might be of significance to him.</p>

<p>Madame Victoria was the first to speak.</p>

<p>“Take a chair, sir,” said she, smiling a bit oddly.
“Your card informs me that you are Detective Carter,
of New York.”</p>

<p>“Yes, madame.”</p>

<p>“My maid said you desire a business interview with
me.”</p>

<p>“If you please.”</p>

<p>“Business from my standpoint, or your own?” inquired
Madame Victoria, still smiling. “In other words, Detective
Carter, does your visit relate to your business or
to mine?”</p>

<p>“The business is ours,” said Nick pointedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>“Ah, sort of a mutual interest,” laughed the woman,
with a captivating glance at him.</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“Then, since you have not called to consult me professionally,”
said the madame, “I shall feel free to drop
my usual mental attitude, that of holding myself susceptible
to outward impressions, and receive you more
conventionally. About what do you wish to see me, Detective
Carter?”</p>

<p>Nick instinctively felt that he was already being
headed off by the woman, and he saw, with half an
eye, if he had not seen it before, that he was up against
a remarkably shrewd and clever character, one who
was nearly his equal in diplomacy and cunning.</p>

<p>Nick briefly set aside the motive with which he had
called, therefore, and reverted to the business which primarily
had sent him to Madame Victoria’s rooms.</p>

<p>“I wish to ask you a few questions,” said he.</p>

<p>“About what?”</p>

<p>“About the recent robbery of yourself and Mrs. Badger,
of Brookline.”</p>

<p>“Ah, indeed!”</p>

<p>“I am engaged by Chief Weston, of the local police
department, to investigate some of these highway robberies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
committed about here, and to undertake the arrest
of the culprits.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I am delighted to hear it, Detective Carter,
and I do hope you’ll succeed,” exclaimed Madame
Victoria, now displaying a very vivacious interest.</p>

<p>“I hope so, too.”</p>

<p>“I have lost some valuable jewels, and so has Claudia—that’s
Mrs. Badger, sir—and I should be more than
glad to recover them.”</p>

<p>“No doubt.”</p>

<p>“Or to aid you in hastening the arrest and conviction
of the thieves,” added the woman. “In what way can I
assist you, Detective Carter?”</p>

<p>“By answering a few questions for me, madame——”</p>

<p>“Pardon!” she interposed.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“You may call me Miss Clayton when not consulting
me professionally, Detective Carter,” she explained,
with a fascinating little laugh. “Like persons in other
fields of art, I practise under an assumed name. If you
ever meet my sister, Mrs. Badger, or her husband, they
will probably refer to me by my real name. So I take
this occasion to tell it to you. It is only here, or when
discussing my professional work, that I make use of my
business name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick wondered if all this had been thrown at him to
convey an impression that she had not been informed
of his call upon Badger and his wife, and a gleam of
new suspicion showed briefly in the eyes of the great
detective. Yet he said quietly, with a nod, that he understood
her.</p>

<p>“It matters little to me what name you use, providing
you answer my questions,” he added.</p>

<p>“I shall gladly do so, Detective Carter.”</p>

<p>“I have here a snap-shot photograph said to have
been taken by you at the time of the robbery.”</p>

<p>“Yes, that is true. I had my kodak with me, and it
so happened that I could——”</p>

<p>“I have been told by Chief Weston how you obtained
the photograph,” interposed Nick, wishing to expedite
matters.</p>

<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>

<p>“What I chiefly wish to know is whether you got a
good look at the thieves, or were too frightened to notice
them closely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I was not greatly alarmed,” smiled Madame Victoria,
with a shrug of her fine shoulders. “I saw that
the loss of our valuables was inevitable, but I did not
fear for my life.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>“Did you specially notice the woman who appears in
this photograph?”</p>

<p>“I saw all that was to be seen of both miscreants,
Detective Carter,” the woman declared, with a nod of
emphasis.</p>

<p>“Did you detect any peculiarity about the woman?”</p>

<p>“Only her unusual height.”</p>

<p>“She was taller than the man?”</p>

<p>“Yes, indeed; several inches taller.”</p>

<p>“Yet in the picture he appears to be nearly six feet.”</p>

<p>“I should judge that he was, as I now recall him.”</p>

<p>“A woman taller than that is very rare,” said Nick,
“and one who should be quite easily traced.”</p>

<p>“That is true, sir.”</p>

<p>“Do you feel quite sure that it was a woman?”</p>

<p>“Sure? Why, certainly!” exclaimed Madame Victoria,
laughing.</p>

<p>“For what reasons?”</p>

<p>“Because, Detective Carter, I saw the point of her
chin under her black veil, and it was as smooth and
white as my own.”</p>

<p>“Anything more?”</p>

<p>“Her hand and arm, too, what little I could see of
the latter in the sleeve of her automobile coat, were as
fair and plump as my own.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick glanced at the pretty hand and arm she held
out, and decided that there could be no mistaking them.</p>

<p>“My first impression, Detective Carter,” she quickly
added, “was the same as yours—that her height might
warrant a suspicion that it was a man in woman’s clothing.
For that reason, sir, I particularly observed her.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of that,” bowed Nick. “I called here
chiefly to settle this question of sex, and I have already
asked Mrs. Badger about it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, indeed! Then you have seen her?”</p>

<p>“I called upon her in Brookline this morning.”</p>

<p>“Does what I say corroborate her statements?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>Nick had mentioned the call only to see if Madame
Victoria would say that she had since heard from the
Badgers, but she did nothing of the kind, leaving Nick
to believe that she had not. This served only to increase
his growing suspicions, when recalling what she
had said that morning; and he now gravely added, with
his gaze indifferently fixed upon her face:</p>

<p>“I think there is only one more question that I would
like to have you answer for me, Madame Victoria.”</p>

<p>“Only one?”</p>

<p>“That is all.”</p>

<p>“Ask it, Detective Carter.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick’s voice fell a little lower, and became more impressive.</p>

<p>“I wish to know what you would have said to me,
Madame Victoria, if I had called to consult you professionally.”</p>

<p>The smile still lingered about the woman’s red lips,
and her eyes met his without flinching.</p>

<p>“I should have said, Detective Carter, what my first
impression impelled me to say, yet which I decided to
repress.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“I should have told you that I felt, when you entered,
as if I were meeting a person who had recently
called here.”</p>

<p>“Did you feel so?”</p>

<p>“I did.”</p>

<p>“How do you now feel about it?”</p>

<p>“I am now sure.”</p>

<p>“Of what?”</p>

<p>“That you were here this morning under the name of
Sibley,” replied Madame Victoria, now frowning slightly.
“I cannot possibly imagine why you came here in disguise
and under an assumed name, Detective Carter, yet
I am convinced that you did so.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>“How did you acquire that knowledge?” Nick now
demanded, ignoring her quiet rebuke.</p>

<p>“I answered that question for Mr. Sibley,” was the
reply, with a covert sneer. “Hence there is no need for
me to answer it for you.”</p>

<p>“You acquired it through your impressions?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“In no other way?”</p>

<p>“None.”</p>

<p>“Then, as Mr. Sibley said this morning, it is very
mysterious,” Nick dryly declared, rising to go.</p>

<p>“So many think, as I said this morning.”</p>

<p>“I will say, Madame Victoria, that I had no more
malicious design in coming here in disguise than that
of proving the validity of some of your claims to occult
powers. I might add, too, that you have given me one
of the most curious problems of my life.”</p>

<p>“Indeed!”</p>

<p>“I shall, however, make it a point to—solve the
problem.”</p>

<p>Madame Victoria laughed, and eyed him oddly from
under her drooping lids.</p>

<p>“If you do solve it, which involves learning how I
get these impressions, Detective Carter, you will do more
than I can,” she said, rising to bid him adieu.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>“Then I certainly shall, Madame Victoria, do more
than you can,” Nick quietly declared, as he accepted her
proffered hand.</p>

<p>“You think so, eh?”</p>

<p>“I do, madame! I have one very pronounced trait of
character, which may be of some interest to you.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“I never drop a mystery, Madame Victoria, until it
has—ceased to be a mystery!”</p>

<p>The last was said pleasantly enough, yet very emphatically,
as Nick bowed and withdrew from the room,
with the smiling eyes of the woman steadily meeting his
till the door closed between the two.</p>

<p>Then there came over her one of those swift changes
seen only when suppressed passions, intensified by restraint,
are abruptly given free rein.</p>

<p>Her smile vanished like a flash, displaced by a frown
that transfigured her every feature and lent to her
usually attractive face the threatening and vengeful
visage of a fury. With eyes gleaming, with lips drawn,
with breast heaving under the sudden swell of her pent
feelings, she shook both clenched hands after the departing
detective, while muttering fiercely through her white
teeth:</p>

<p>“Yon will solve the problem, will you? You will tear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
away the veil of mystery, will you? Not if I know it—not
if I can prevent it, Mr. Nick Carter!</p>

<p>“Beware what you do—what you attempt! Let the
cost be what it may, my prediction shall be fulfilled, and
only failure shall be yours! Beware lest you fail, for
the inevitable price of failure will be—death!”</p>

<p>Then she turned and hurried across the room, with
every movement of her lithe and supple figure as quick
and graceful as those of a leopard. With a quick sweep
of her arm, she threw aside the curtain of a door of a
small closet, into which she entered, to seize the receiver
from a telephone attached to the wall.</p>

<p>“Give me 22 ring 2, Brookline!” she commanded.</p>

<p>It was the number of the telephone in the house of
Mr. Amos Badger.</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.
<br />
<small>UNDER THE SURFACE.</small></h2>


<p>As Nick Carter had rightly conjectured, when weighing
the mystifying knowledge displayed by Madame
Victoria, there was something under the surface.</p>

<p>What the something was, moreover, plainly appeared
in what followed the visit of Nick to the suburban house
of Mr. Amos Badger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span></p>

<p>The moment the detective departed, in company with
Grady, there came over both Badger and his wife a very
decided change.</p>

<p>With an ugly gleam in his dark eyes, which were still
following the runabout as it sped down the long driveway,
Badger ripped off the red flannel bandages from
around his neck, exclaiming vehemently:</p>

<p>“Whew! these infernal things have set me reeking at
every pore! Thank Heaven he remained no longer, or
I should have run down into my boots. There’s not a
dry rag on me.”</p>

<p>His wife indulged in a laugh, a vicious little laugh,
most unpleasant to honest ears.</p>

<p>“Yet the ruse worked well, Amos,” she cried exultantly.</p>

<p>“Yes, apparently.”</p>

<p>“Apparently?”</p>

<p>“That’s what I said,” growled Badger, as the runabout
passed out of view.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” demanded Claudia, with quickened
apprehension.</p>

<p>“I mean that there never is any knowing what Nick
Carter thinks and suspects, however he may carry himself,”
Badger petulantly replied. “He is one thing on
the surface, another under it. There is no telling anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
about him, and I’m infernally sorry that Weston
has brought him over here.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” cried his wife contemptuously. “He can accomplish
no more than the Boston detectives have done.”</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of it.”</p>

<p>“We can fool him as we have fooled the others.”</p>

<p>“Yet he asked some deucedly ugly questions,” declared
Badger, with a doubtful shake of his head. “And
I more than half-fear that he already suspects our trick.”</p>

<p>“Suspects that you were only feigning illness?”</p>

<p>“Possibly.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense! He cannot have got wise to that, nor
to anything else that seriously affects us.”</p>

<p>Badger turned quickly away, and hailed the man in
the driveway.</p>

<p>“Come in here, Jerry,” he commanded. “I want to
speak to you.”</p>

<p>Conley dropped his work and hastened into the house,
following Badger and his wife into the library.</p>

<p>“What d’ye want, Amos?” he inquired, with a familiarity
plainly indicating that he was something more
than a menial about the place.</p>

<p>“I want to I know just what Carter said to you,” replied
Badger, throwing himself into a chair.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>“He only asked if I’d seen an auto go along the road
below here.”</p>

<p>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p>“I thought I heard him say something about me,
Conley, and the cut of my jib.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was only because he couldn’t learn anything
from me, and he didn’t fancy the jolly I was giving
him,” replied Conley, with a grin. “Devil a thing did I
tell him, Amos, and I was only keeping him on a string
till I was dead sure that you and Claudy were out of
your auto rigs and into the togs in which he found
you.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure he didn’t get sight of the other machine?”
demanded Badger apprehensively.</p>

<p>“The one you used when you held him up?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’m dead sure that he didn’t see that,” cried
Conley confidently. “I had that in the secret cover a
good five minutes before he showed up in the runabout.”</p>

<p>“And you were at work on the other when he arrived?”</p>

<p>“Yes, long before he arrived.”</p>

<p>“Pshaw! he couldn’t have seen the Peerless when he
got here, Amos,” supplemented Claudia decidedly. “We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
left that runabout behind us as if it had been tied to a
stake.”</p>

<p>“I know all that,” growled Badger; “but I want to
feel sure that the infernal detective got no line on us
after he reached here. I’ll tell you both, he’s a man to
be feared, and we cannot be too careful in case he undertakes
to round us up.”</p>

<p>“Faugh!” snarled Conley, with a scowl rising about
his crafty eyes. “If he gets wise, and presses us too
hard, there’s one thing we can do.”</p>

<p>“Put him out of the way?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“It will have to be done,” said Badger, with a nod.
“Yet I don’t fancy running my neck into a noose if it
can be avoided.”</p>

<p>“It can be done without that,” said Conley, with grim
significance.</p>

<p>“It strikes me,” put in Claudia, “that we ought to give
Vic a tip that Carter is coming to call upon her, also
that he has been out here.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too.”</p>

<p>“If he is as clever as you say he is, Amos, he must
be handled with gloves,” added the woman. “Vic ought
to be warned of his visit, and of what his business consists,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
so that she may be ready for him, and head him
off from any suspicion.”</p>

<p>“I can inform her by telephone.”</p>

<p>“It must be done.”</p>

<p>“There’s no great rush,” replied Badger. “Carter will
not arrive there for an hour.”</p>

<p>“You must tell her just what we have done, and why
we did it.”</p>

<p>“Tell her that we held him up this morning?”</p>

<p>“Yes, certainly; also that we got away with his watch
and money.”</p>

<p>“Why tell her all that?”</p>

<p>“So she may know just how to handle him,” declared
Claudia, with knit brows. “Vic is clever, all right, but
she may queer us in some way when pitted against Nick
Carter’s cleverness, unless she knows just what his game
is, and what has happened out here.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go and talk with her at once,” said Badger, now
rising.</p>

<p>“A good idea,” said Conley approvingly. “Let Vic
alone to queer any game that he may have.”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment, Amos,” cried his wife, with an afterthought.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“If Carter has formed any suspicion of us, as you appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
to fear, he may start in at once with some of his
underhand work.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“He may not tell Vic who he is.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not.”</p>

<p>“And he may lead her into some self-betrayal, in case
he questions her closely while she is ignorant of his
identity.”</p>

<p>“What the deuce can we do to prevent that?” demanded
Badger, with a frown.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what,” said Claudia, who plainly possessed
many of the crafty qualities of her sister.</p>

<p>“Well, out with it.”</p>

<p>“First, Amos, describe him to her so she cannot mistake
him, and then——”</p>

<p>“Hold on a bit,” interrupted Conley, who was an interested
listener. “He may take it into his head to go
there in disguise, since that’s a clever trick of his.”</p>

<p>“That’s just what I was coming to, Jerry, if you had
let me finish,” snapped Mrs. Badger. “We can easily
head off any disguise he may adopt.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Merely by telling Vic that he wears a red carbuncle
ring on the third finger of his left hand,” said Claudia.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
“He’ll not think it necessary to remove that, Amos, even
if he does put on a disguise.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! that’s so.”</p>

<p>“Go, now, and tell her the whole business.”</p>

<p>Badger hastened into the hall, where he was presently
heard imparting in cautious terms, yet which he evidently
knew would be readily understood, the information concerning
Nick which had so puzzled him.</p>

<p>It was because of what she now was told over the
wire that Madame Victoria glanced first at Nick’s left
hand when he entered her rooms, and at once recognized
him in the disguise of Sibley.</p>

<p>At the time of his second visit, moreover, when he
presented his own card, the fortune-teller at once noticed
that he had removed the ring, and that alone was
enough to convince her that he was beginning to play a
double game, and that he must have formed some suspicions
regarding herself and the Badgers.</p>

<p>After Nick’s first departure she telephoned Badger
that he had been there, and the latter then held a second
consultation with his wife and Conley.</p>

<p>Being ignorant of Nick’s primary object in visiting
Madame Victoria in disguise, which was merely to test
her peculiar powers, Badger’s apprehensions naturally
were increased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s wise to something, and already up to some
game against us, or he wouldn’t have gone there in
disguise,” he gravely reasoned. “I’m ruined, utterly
ruined, unless we can continue this road work a few
weeks longer. I shall be swamped completely unless I
can thus raise the funds to tide me along until there’s a
rise in the stock-market.”</p>

<p>“We’ll keep up the road-work, Amos, never you
fear,” his wife curtly declared, with an evil brightness
in her expressive eyes. “It was I who suggested it to
you, and I have done my part to help you along with
it.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough.”</p>

<p>“And we’ll not quit it now, Amos, Carter or no Carter.”</p>

<p>“That we’ll not,” growled Conley, with a headshake.
“There’s too much good stuff in it for us to have it
queered at this stage by this man Carter. If it comes
to the worst, Amos, a knife between his ribs will put
him out of our way.”</p>

<p>“That is more easily said than done.”</p>

<p>“Not if it comes to that kind of a play.”</p>

<p>“I don’t fear Weston and his second-rate detectives,”
added Badger moodily; “but this man Carter is superior
to that entire bunch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>“Bah!” cried Claudia. “You are needlessly alarmed.
To begin with, Amos, he cannot possibly have learned
anything definite about us as quickly as this.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not.”</p>

<p>“He could not have identified us as the couple who
held him up and robbed him this morning, and he certainly
must think that was only a chance job, not one
planned by us the moment we heard he was coming out
here in a runabout.”</p>

<p>“No, he could not have guessed that,” admitted
Badger.</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” argued his wife, “my face was entirely
covered with my dust-glasses and the false beard,
and in my big auto coat it certainly could not have been
suspected that I was a woman who suddenly showed
up in the Peerless in which you escaped after robbing
him.”</p>

<p>“Sure it couldn’t,” put in Conley. “I’d have sworn
you were a man myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t think he has any idea of the truth about
that,” replied Badger.</p>

<p>“There is still another thing in our favor,” continued
Claudia.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“The alleged robbery of Vic and myself, Amos, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the photograph which Vic took by which to convince
Weston of the truth of our story.”</p>

<p>“That was one of the shrewdest moves ever made,”
declared Conley, laughing.</p>

<p>“Certainly it was, Jerry, and you may let Vic alone to
think of such schemes as that,” said Mrs. Badger, with
an evil display of sisterly pride.</p>

<p>“She’s a keen one, all right,” grinned Conley.</p>

<p>“The picture is as good as a positive proof that we
were robbed,” added Claudia; “and Weston never for
a moment has doubted our story. The very fact, if it
were a fact, that we were robbed, moreover, plainly
shows that we cannot have been both the thieves and
the victims, also. That would be absurd, you see, and
as long as Carter credits the photograph, just so long
we may be sure that he does not suspect us of being
crooks.”</p>

<p>“That is an ugly word to apply to us, Claudia,”
growled Badger disapprovingly.</p>

<p>“One might as well call things by their right names,”
laughed his wife. “I told you I was an adventuress, and
a woman of nerve, Amos, when you wanted to marry
me, and you knew just what you bargained for.”</p>

<p>“I’m finding no fault on that score.”</p>

<p>“You’d better not,” was the pointed rejoinder. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
fancy the life I now lead, this moving in good society,
for it lays away over the stage, or riding bareback in
the circus-ring, to which Vic and I were bred in old
England.”</p>

<p>“What need to refer to those days?” muttered Badger,
frowning darkly.</p>

<p>“Only that you may keep in mind the stuff I am
made of,” replied his wife, with a shrug of her shoulders.
“When you told me you were in hot water financially,
Amos, it was I who suggested this scheme of road
robbery to tide you along. In becoming your assistant,
along with Jerry, here, my old life of adventure has
served me well. I can ride the most vicious horse, and
no auto can go too fast for me, Amos; so you couldn’t
have a better helper, whether I wear skirts or trousers,
in holding up an auto-party.”</p>

<p>“That’s true enough.”</p>

<p>“As for the wickedness of it—well, most of the world
is wicked in one way or another,” laughed the woman.
“We must contrive to get our living, Amos, in some
way; and this life of danger and adventure just suits
me, to say nothing of the profits derived. Just think!—last
month we cleaned up close to twenty thousand,
providing those Gaylord jewels bring as much as we
expect.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, there’s money enough in it, I’ll admit that,”
nodded Badger.</p>

<p>“And with Vic to help us, with the aid of the friend
she has so completely under her thumb, we are sure to
be informed of any move contemplated by Weston or by
Nick Carter. So your fears are groundless, Amos, as I
said in the beginning.”</p>

<p>“It’s dead lucky, I’ll admit, that we have that anchor
to the windward,” said Badger, with features now relaxing.</p>

<p>“So it is, Amos, and with him to inform us of—— Hark!
there goes the telephone-bell again. I’ll wager
that Vic has something more to report.”</p>

<p>Claudia Badger was right in the last.</p>

<p>Madame Victoria now reported the second visit of
Nick Carter, and all that had passed between them; also
explained Nick’s simple object in first calling upon her
in disguise, and stated that he came last only to ask
about the woman in the photograph.</p>

<p>“I have him well muddled, Amos,” was Madame Victoria’s
last declaration over the wire. “There is nothing
to be feared from him at present.”</p>

<p>Badger’s dark countenance lighted while he listened,
and he hastened to report the communication to his wife
and Conley.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>

<p>“There! what did I tell you?” cried Claudia triumphantly.
“I knew that Vic would prove more than
a match even for Nick Carter. Now, there is just one
thing to be done in order to avert suspicion from us.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“These road robberies must continue to occur,” declared
the woman. “If they suddenly end at this time,
after Carter’s visit here, he very possibly may infer that
we are alarmed, providing he has any suspicion at all
concerning us. Another robbery committed this very
night would clinch matters in our favor.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too,” said Conley, quickly seeing the
point.</p>

<p>It was done, moreover, and one of the boldest yet
committed, and the reports of it filled the morning papers,
along with no end of editorials decrying the inferior
work of the police in being unable to prevent such
depredations.</p>

<p>But the end was not yet, for that very day Chief
Weston removed his own men from the case, and placed
it entirely in charge of Nick Carter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.
<br />
<small>BODY AND LIMBS.</small></h2>


<p>“Chick, I’m hit with an idea!”</p>

<p>This exclamation came from Nick Carter about ten
o’clock one morning, two days after the highway robbery
last reported, and the talk that followed showed
with what remarkable insight this great detective arrived
at the subtle deductions which contributed largely
to his success.</p>

<p>Chick and Patsy had arrived in Boston two days before,
and both were now present with Nick in his room
at the Adams House.</p>

<p>Both had been fully informed of the facts thus far
learned by him, moreover, as well as of his interview
with the Badgers, and his visits to Madame Victoria.</p>

<p>When he uttered the above exclamation Nick was
seated at one of the windows of his room.</p>

<p>In one hand he held the photograph that figured so
curiously in the case, and which would have convinced
any ordinary detective that Madame Victoria and Mrs.
Amos Badger had been robbed precisely as alleged, for
the camera, at least, would not have lied.</p>

<p>Yet this bit of convincing evidence was so out of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
ordinary, as well as the circumstances under which it
had been obtained, that Nick from the very first had
been inclined to distrust the picture.</p>

<p>In his other hand he now held a large magnifying-glass,
through which he was carefully studying the photograph,
holding it in the full glare of the morning sunlight.</p>

<p>“What’s that, Nick?” inquired Chick, starting up
from his chair and dropping a morning paper reporting
the last robbery. “Hit with an idea, did you say?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“What is it, Mr. Carter?” asked Patsy, at once displaying
a lively interest. “Have you discovered something
lame in that picture?”</p>

<p>Nick laughed.</p>

<p>“That about hits the nail on the head, Patsy,” said he,
with a glance in the lad’s direction. “I think I begin to
see a ray of light in the darkness.”</p>

<p>“What have you discovered?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>And both he and Patsy came to lean over the back
of Nick’s chair.</p>

<p>Nick held the large glass and the photograph so that
all three could plainly view the magnified picture.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain what I find, and I wonder that I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
not noticed it before,” said he quite earnestly. “It relates
to this tall woman who appears in the picture.”</p>

<p>“Gee! but she is a tall one,” remarked Patsy, with a
laugh. “She’s tall enough to fit in a dime museum.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Patsy,” assented Nick, smiling.</p>

<p>“What’s peculiar about it, Nick?”</p>

<p>“As you probably know, Chick, there is a general uniformity
in the proportions of the human body—a regular
length of arms and limbs when compared with the trunk.
In all normal subjects the proportions are nearly the
same.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” nodded Chick. “A man’s reach, from the tips
of his extended arms and fingers, is usually the same as
his height.”</p>

<p>“Correct.”</p>

<p>“But what has that to do with the picture, Mr. Carter?”
asked Patsy.</p>

<p>“It has to do with this woman,” Nick rejoined, drawing
out his pencil to be used for a pointer. “I want you
to notice her extended arm and hand, the one in which
she held the leveled revolver.”</p>

<p>“That’s plain enough, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s good fortune that it is, Patsy,” nodded Nick.
“It also is plain, now that I study it closely, that the arm
is a little out of proportion with her exceeding height.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>“By Jove! it does appear so!” exclaimed Chick, bending
nearer to view the pictured figure.</p>

<p>“Notice the distance from her shoulder to her hand,
then the distance from her shoulder to her hip, which is
plainly outlined by this curve of her long auto coat. Her
hip is here, Chick, where I have the point of my pencil.”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Notice, now, that her extended hand, if it were to be
dropped to her side, would reach only to this point,
measuring the same distance, a point only a trifle below
her hip.”</p>

<p>“That’s clear,” cried Chick. “Yet the camera may——”</p>

<p>“The camera never lies,” interposed Nick.</p>

<p>“Then the woman must be out of proportion,” declared
Chick.</p>

<p>“Not necessarily.”</p>

<p>“But her arm should be longer than it appears there,”
Chick insisted. “I’m well-proportioned, I’ll swear to
that, and my hand, when lowered, reaches half-way down
my thigh.”</p>

<p>“Which is about right, Chick.”</p>

<p>“Yet you say the woman is not out of proportion——”</p>

<p>“I said not necessarily,” interposed Nick. “If she
was as tall as she appears in the picture, however, I’ll
admit that her arm would be too short for her body.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oho, I see!” exclaimed Patsy, starting up. “You
think, Mr. Carter, that she is not as tall as the picture
indicates.”</p>

<p>“That’s exactly it, Patsy,” nodded Nick.</p>

<p>“How do you make it out?” asked Chick.</p>

<p>“Notice this fold of her skirt, where the skirt shows
below the edge of her auto coat?”</p>

<p>“Well, what of it?”</p>

<p>“Plainly enough, Chick, the fold does not hang quite
naturally,” Nick went on to explain, still pointing with
his pencil. “It appears drawn a little to one side and
back of her, with the edge of the skirt carefully arranged
to touch the ground, precisely as if to conceal something
beneath it.”</p>

<p>“Something on which she was standing!” exclaimed
Chick, quickly seeing the point.</p>

<p>“That’s just it,” declared Nick impressively. “No
skirt ever hung quite like that, if it hung naturally.”</p>

<p>“Surely not.”</p>

<p>“Notice also the distance from her hip to the edge of
the skirt, where her feet should be,” added Nick. “Her
limbs would be as much above the regular proportions
as her arm is below them.”</p>

<p>“I see what you mean.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<p>“In a nutshell, Chick, such an anomaly could not be,”
continued Nick decisively. “A person with abnormally
long legs and disproportionately short arms is out of
the question.”</p>

<p>“And in your opinion——”</p>

<p>“In my opinion, Chick, the woman was standing on
something, possibly a rock, with her skirts lengthened to
conceal it. Obviously the whole was done to give her
the appearance of being very tall.”</p>

<p>“And with what object?”</p>

<p>“With a design to thus blind the police to the real
looks of the woman operating with this gang of crooks.”</p>

<p>“You think they aimed to send the police searching
after some very tall woman?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll wager you are right.”</p>

<p>“Furthermore,” added Nick, “these discoveries conclusively
prove that the picture was deliberately taken,
with the several persons calmly posing to make it effective,
and that the two women said to have been held
up and robbed were not robbed at all.”</p>

<p>“And the design of the photograph?”</p>

<p>“It was taken purposely to be offered as evidence to
corroborate the story told to the police.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>“With a view to averting suspicion and throwing
them off the right track,” added Chick.</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“By thunder, that was a crafty scheme!” declared
Patsy, rather pleased with the originality of it.</p>

<p>“Yes, it was crafty enough,” assented Nick. “But
the rascals overleaped their mount, Patsy, in not anticipating
the deductions I have mentioned. All this
sheds a new and very bright light upon the case,” the
speaker added, as he tossed the photograph upon the
table.</p>

<p>“I should say so,” nodded Chick, resuming his chair
and lighting a cigar. “It indicates that those two
women, who claim to have been robbed, may be in league
with this gang of thieves.”</p>

<p>“Even more than that, Chick.”</p>

<p>“What more, Nick?”</p>

<p>“It suggests that Badger himself may be one of the
gang, if not the chief figure in it, and that their headquarters
may be at that isolated suburban place of his.”</p>

<p>“By Jove, that may be so!”</p>

<p>“Let’s look a little deeper, Chick, and see how far
some of the other facts sustain this theory. I was held
up when on my way out there Tuesday morning,” continued
Nick. “That may have been merely a coincidence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
the scamps possibly having been laying in wait
for some victim, though there still remains a chance
of something even more than that under the surface.”</p>

<p>“Decidedly so,” replied Chick. “Such things don’t
often happen by chance.”</p>

<p>“We’ll investigate that a little later.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“After the hold-up, Chick, I hastened to Badger’s
house, arriving there within ten minutes after the robbery,”
Nick went on.</p>

<p>“Then it must have occurred pretty near his place.”</p>

<p>“Within half a mile.”</p>

<p>“That, too, is significant.”</p>

<p>“In a measure,” assented Nick. “I found his chauffeur
cleaning a Stanley machine in the driveway, where I
could not help observing him. Ordinarily such a job
would be done in the stable or garage, and I am now inclined
to think that it was done outside only intentionally
to make me believe, in case of any distrust, that
Badger uses a Stanley machine, and not such a car as
that in which I saw the thieves escape.”</p>

<p>“Do you know how many machines he owns?”</p>

<p>“I do not, Chick. In fact, I know very little about
him or his place.”</p>

<p>“We’ll make it a point to learn.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>“I did not fancy the looks nor air of his chauffeur,”
continued Nick. “He appeared to avoid my questions,
and I now suspect that may have been done to give
Badger time to get out of his rig as a highwayman and
into the house suit and red flannel bandages in which
he received me.”</p>

<p>“You think that whole business was designed only to
blind you, in case you had any suspicions?”</p>

<p>“That certainly would have been the design, Chick,
providing that we are justified in suspecting him at all.”</p>

<p>“There are too many of these significant little circumstances,
Nick, for us to doubt that we are hitting somewhere
near the mark,” Chick shrewdly reasoned.</p>

<p>“That’s the way I now regard them,” said Nick.
“After my talk with Badger, in which I stated I should
call upon Madame Victoria, he may have telephoned the
fact to the fortune-teller. I noticed that he had a telephone
in the hall.”</p>

<p>“That would explain her knowledge of you, Nick,”
said Chick. “But bear in mind that you were in disguise
when you first called upon her.”</p>

<p>“I remember that, Chick.”</p>

<p>“How can she have known you?”</p>

<p>“Badger may have been alarmed by my visit,” argued
Nick, “and he possibly suspected that I might adopt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
some disguise. Very likely he mentioned some distinctive
feature about my person, one which I would not
ordinarily remove, by which Madame Victoria may have
identified me.”</p>

<p>“That may have been the case,” admitted Chick.</p>

<p>“The knowledge she displayed certainly points to
some such move on Badger’s part, and adds to our
grounds for suspicion,” continued Nick. “She had me
well marked in some way, there is no denying that.
Furthermore, the fact that she warned me to drop the
perilous business I was about to undertake, predicting
that I should meet only with failure, points plainly to a
possibility that they were taking that method to influence
me to drop the case.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!” exclaimed Patsy. “That now looks dead
open and shut, Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“It certainly is significant.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you landed right in the midst of this gang of
road thieves. In that case, Nick, the rest of our work
should be easy,” Chick quickly remarked. “It should
be child’s play for us to round them up.”</p>

<p>Nick thoughtfully shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that, Chick,” said he. “We as yet
have no tangible evidence against them, and nothing less
will serve us in a court of law,” replied Nick.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>“Our theory is built chiefly upon trivial circumstances,
all of which are significant enough, I’ll admit, and sufficiently
numerous to warrant considerable suspicion. But
we must secure more positive evidence before we can
take any decisive action against these suspects.”</p>

<p>“I guess that is right, Nick.”</p>

<p>“We ought to get the evidence easily enough, if we
really have located the crooks,” declared Patsy.</p>

<p>Nick Carter laughed again, with a glance at the eager
eyes of the youthful detective.</p>

<p>“That one word, really, is quite important, Patsy,”
said he. “It is barely possible that we are mistaken, at
least in part, if not entirely so. Circumstantial evidence
is never wholly trustworthy.”</p>

<p>“I’ll bet you are right, sir, for all that,” insisted Patsy,
with abiding faith in Nick’s shrewdness.</p>

<p>“I shall first make sure that I am,” said Nick, “by
taking some step to confirm my theory. As for securing
the evidence with which to convict these rascals, Patsy,
that may not be done as easily as you think. If they become
wary, fearing that we suspect them, they not only
may drop the business entirely for a time, but may also
cover their past tracks so cleverly as to conceal the evidence
that we require.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hadn’t thought of that, sir.”</p>

<p>“It’s too true for a joke, Nick, and we cannot be too
careful and crafty at the outset,” Chick gravely put in,
now taking the measure of the case quite as clearly as
Nick himself. “What do you intend doing?”</p>

<p>“Personally, Chick, I am going down to State Street
this morning, and see what I can learn about Badger.
Then I am going up to police headquarters and return
these documents to Chief Weston. He loaned them to
me that I might learn what lines of investigation his
men have followed.”</p>

<p>“Do they appear to have accomplished anything?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more than to note in detail the facts of the
various robberies,” smiled Nick. “Not one of them has
hit upon a rational clue.”</p>

<p>“Is there anything you want us to do while you are
thus engaged?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I want you and Patsy to go out to Brookline
and see what you can discover at Badger’s place,” replied
Nick. “I don’t want you to be seen about there, however.”</p>

<p>“H’m! Let us alone to be discreet.”</p>

<p>“His estate is backed by quite an extensive woodland,
through which you can easily approach after locating the
place.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>“That will be an advantage.”</p>

<p>“Take what time you require,” added Nick, “and
learn how many men are employed in and about the
house and stable. Also learn how many automobiles and
horses he keeps. Several of these hold-ups have been
committed by horsemen, and I wish to learn what Badger
owns in both lines.”</p>

<p>“Automobiles and horses?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“We’ll ferret out the whole business, Mr. Carter, trust
us for that,” cried Patsy, impatient to be at work.</p>

<p>“Meantime,” said Nick, rising, “I’ll employ myself as
stated. It is now half-past ten. You may require three
or four hours to learn what I would like to know, so
we will plan to meet here again about an hour or two
before dinner, say at four o’clock.”</p>

<p>“That will give us ample time,” declared Chick. “We’ll
be here at four sharp.”</p>

<p>“You’ll find me here,” said Nick, with no thought that
anything would occur to prevent him.</p>

<p>The three left the house together, parting at the
Washington Street door, both Chick and Patsy heading
for the subway to take a Brookline trolley car. Neither
so much as dreamed, however, that many an anxious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
hour would pass before they again saw Nick’s familiar
face or heard his genial voice.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.
<br />
<small>THE ANCHOR TO WINDWARD.</small></h2>


<p>As he had stated to his assistants before leaving the
Adams House that morning, Nick Carter hastened down
to State Street to see what he could learn about Amos
Badger.</p>

<p>With his wide acquaintance and friendly relations with
the bankers and brokers, both in New York and Boston,
it was an easy matter for Nick to ascertain, without
disclosing his motives, the facts which he aimed to discover.</p>

<p>He learned from perfectly reliable sources that Badger,
who had no partner in business, was heavily long
of stocks in the market, a market that had been steadily
declining for months; also, that his loan-account on this
class of collateral had been repeatedly subjected to calls
for additional margins, which were known to have been
met only with considerable difficulty and delay.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, Nick easily discovered that Badger had
for months been in financial hot water, yet had succeeded
in tiding himself along up to date.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Nick now thought he could guess by what desperate
means this man was raising the funds required to meet
his increasing obligations from day to day.</p>

<p>Incidentally, however, Nick learned other facts for
which he was not specially seeking, yet which further
confirmed the theory he had so shrewdly formed.</p>

<p>These facts related to Badger’s wife and her sister,
the Tremont Street fortune-teller, and were imparted to
Nick a bit maliciously by a broker who had suffered in
one way or another through Madame Victoria, and who
was informed of the history of the two women.</p>

<p>Briefly stated, as it was given to Nick, both were
born in England, the daughters of a second-rate actor
and manager of various itinerant amusement enterprises,
in none of which he had achieved any great success.</p>

<p>The two girls had some little talent in one way or another,
however, and both had spent their earlier years in
the show business, filling such positions as the various
enterprises of their father, since dead, required.</p>

<p>Now as an alleged gipsy fortune-teller, now as a
palmist, at other times an astrologer, or some like attraction
under a different name, but always as a sideshow
to some other amusement, the younger of the two
had acquired that experience which, after the marriage
of her sister and her coming to America, had enabled her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to establish in Boston the business now conducted under
the name of Madame Victoria.</p>

<p>The elder of the two, now Badger’s wife, had sung on
the stage, done turns in the concert-halls, and in earlier
years had been an accomplished equestrienne in the
circus-ring, from the first of which Badger had married
her in Manchester, about five years before.</p>

<p>That both women were little more than adventuresses
of a rather disreputable type, Nick’s informant positively
assured him, and this further confirmed his theory
and convinced him that he was on the right track.</p>

<p>It was early afternoon when he arrived at police headquarters,
in Pemberton Square, and entered the general
office previously described.</p>

<p>It so happened that Chief Weston was in this office at
the time, though all of the detectives not then assigned
to outside work were either out at lunch or in the officers’
lounging-room.</p>

<p>It so happened, also, since Satan sometimes serves his
own, that the only other occupant of the general office
was the clerk whom Nick had encountered there several
days before—Mr. Sandy Hyde.</p>

<p>The brick-hued head of the latter was raised from over
his books upon hearing the detective’s name mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
in greeting, and his catlike eyes lighted with quickened
interest.</p>

<p>“Ah, good morning, Nick!” was Chief Weston’s greeting.
“Anything doing?”</p>

<p>“I wish to return these reports, chief, which I took
from you a few days ago,” replied Nick, producing them
from his pocket.</p>

<p>“No further use for them?”</p>

<p>“Not at present.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“I will retain this photograph, however, which I may
use to advantage a little later.”</p>

<p>“You’ve not hit upon a clue from that, have you?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not prepared to say,” demurred Nick, a bit
evasively.</p>

<p>“Come inside,” Chief Weston abruptly said, quick to
notice Nick’s hesitation. “We shall not be interrupted
in my office. Bear that in mind, Sandy.”</p>

<p>“All right, chief.”</p>

<p>“This way, Nick.”</p>

<p>Nick entered the enclosure, and passed through the
passage leading to the chief’s, private office.</p>

<p>He did not so much as glance at the clerk, however,
whose head had again dropped over his books.</p>

<p>Snap!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>The catch-lock announced that the door of the private
office had securely closed.</p>

<p>Now Mr. Sandy Hyde dropped his pen, and came
down from his stool.</p>

<p>For a moment he peered sharply through the brass
lattice along the top of the desks, toward the two open
doors leading into the adjoining corridors.</p>

<p>Next he darted out of the enclosure, and quickly closed
both of these doors.</p>

<p>No cat’s eyes aglow from a dark corner ever burned
more greenishly bright and intense than those of this
watchful miscreant at that moment.</p>

<p>It was for him a moment of peril, and well he knew
it; yet, in the event of an intruder into the outer office,
he relied upon hearing one of the closed doors opened
in time to evade detection.</p>

<p>With both closed, he next hurried back into the enclosure,
from outside of which the interior of the narrow
passage could only partly be seen.</p>

<p>Into this passage Hyde quickly entered, with the
stealthy quietude of a shadow, and stood listening at the
chief’s door, his ear touching the panel, his eyes still
bright with a satanic glow evincing his evil impulse.</p>

<p>His several precautions had required but a very few
seconds, moreover, and he lost hardly a word of Nick<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
Carter’s brief interview with Chief Weston, who was
about repeating his question just as the eavesdropper arrived
at the door.</p>

<p>“You’ve not struck a clue from that photograph, Nick,
have you?”</p>

<p>Nick was never much inclined to reveal his discoveries
before they culminated in some decisive move, and he
again evaded the question by saying:</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not quite sure about that, Weston.”</p>

<p>“What do you suspect?”</p>

<p>“Nothing at all definite as yet,” laughed Nick indifferently.
“I wish to retain the photograph a while longer,
however, if you have no objection.”</p>

<p>“None whatever, Nick, yet you pique my curiosity.”</p>

<p>“I will explain later.”</p>

<p>“Very well.”</p>

<p>“I presume that Madame Victoria could easily show
me the exact spot where this hold-up occurred,” remarked
Nick, who had remained standing beside the
chiefs desk.</p>

<p>“I imagine so, Nick.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to have her take me out there.”</p>

<p>“For what purpose?”</p>

<p>“I want to see what sort of a place these crooks
usually select for their rascally work.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>“I should say that you already had seen that,” laughed
Weston, who had been informed of Nick’s encounter
with them.</p>

<p>Nick shrugged his broad shoulders, smiling meaningly,
and said:</p>

<p>“I wish to see how the two localities correspond. As
for my lost property, Weston, I’ll make an even bet that
I recover it sooner or later.”</p>

<p>The last was said a bit resentfully, and with a significance
that brought a quick change over Weston’s face.</p>

<p>“You’ve got wise to something, Nick!” he abruptly
exclaimed.</p>

<p>Nick laughed again.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather inform you a little later, Weston.”</p>

<p>“Just as you like, of course, but I’m really curious to
know what you have learned.”</p>

<p>“I’m not quite sure of it yet, chief, and I’d prefer
making sure before I indulge in any revelations,” said
Nick, with a shake of his head. “It’s not my way, you
know, to make disclosures which later may prove to be
groundless.”</p>

<p>“I’m well aware of that, Nick.”</p>

<p>“If it will afford you any satisfaction, however, I will
make one definite statement.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Merely this, Weston,” Nick forcibly declared. “I
will land these crooks for you, every man and woman of
them, or I’ll throw up my commission.”</p>

<p>The ear at the panel was strained at that moment,
and the glow in the eyes of the listener became a threatening
flame.</p>

<p>“Well, well, that ought to be good enough for anybody,”
cried Weston, with much satisfaction. “I felt
sure that you had run upon something worth knowing.”</p>

<p>Nick nodded significantly, yet replied quite indifferently:</p>

<p>“I think that I have, Weston, and, when I am dead
sure of it, I will tell you of what it consists.”</p>

<p>“All right, Nick,” was the reply, with a genial laugh.
“I said in the beginning that you should not be interfered
with in this case, and that goes at any stage of it.
Run it in your own way, Nick, and you’ll suit me.”</p>

<p>“I’m only a bit curious to go out to the scene of this
robbery,” Nick now added, with a glance at the photograph
which he was replacing in his pocket. “If I
can catch Madame Victoria at her rooms after I have
lunched, I think I can get her to ride out there with me.”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it, Nick. She’ll be glad enough to do<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
anything that gives promise of the recovery of her property.”</p>

<p>Nick smiled a bit oddly, and prepared to depart.</p>

<p>“I shall drop in to see her about two o’clock,” said
Nick. “I reckon I can bring her to my way of thinking.”</p>

<p>“When shall I see you again?” asked Weston, rising.</p>

<p>“Within a day or two.”</p>

<p>“I wish you luck meantime.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed and shook his head, saying with considerable
dryness:</p>

<p>“I depend less upon luck, Weston, than upon labor
and head-work. If I can make nothing out of this case
with my brains, I have no faith that luck will do it for
me. As I said before, Weston, I’ll see you within a day
or two.”</p>

<p>The listening ear had left the panel of the door.</p>

<p>The catlike tread had pattered quickly through the
passage and out of the enclosure, and again the corridor
doors stood open.</p>

<p>There had been no intruder during the brief interview,
and a look of evil exultation had risen in the eyes
of Mr. Sandy Hyde.</p>

<p>As Amos Badger had declared to his confederates one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
recent morning, it was, indeed, dead lucky that they had—this
anchor to the windward.</p>

<p>For it was this miscreant who had warned Badger of
Nick Carter’s arrival in Boston, and of his acceptance
of this case.</p>

<p>It was this miscreant who had informed Badger of
Nick’s intended visit the same morning, and who had
made possible the hold-up which to Nick had appeared so
like a coincidence.</p>

<p>It was this miscreant, too, whose treachery now bid
fair to cost Nick Carter his life, yet whom the latter,
with all his keenness, was far from suspecting.</p>

<p>For who looks for treachery in high places, or in
those from whom only loyalty is most naturally expected?</p>

<p>The catlike eyes had lost their greenish glow, and the
brick-hued head was again bowed above the books, when
Nick and Chief Weston came striding through the passage
and out of the enclosure.</p>

<p>Nick did not delay his departure any longer, and
without a word to the clerk, Chief Weston returned to
his private office.</p>

<p>It was then one o’clock.</p>

<p>Five minutes later the head clerk came in from lunch,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
and Sandy Hyde at once laid down his pen and began
putting on his street coat.</p>

<p>The next hour was his own—and he thought he knew
how he could best use it.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.
<br />
<small>THE INCENTIVE TO TREACHERY.</small></h2>


<p>Ten minutes after leaving police headquarters Sandy
Hyde might have been seen slinking across the Tremont
Street mall of Boston Common.</p>

<p>Yet only a close observer would have recognized the
treacherous little rascal.</p>

<p>He had his coat-collar turned well up about his ears,
his soft felt hat drawn forward over his brow, and with
his handkerchief held to his face his crafty countenance
was for the most part concealed.</p>

<p>Presently he glided across the street, then hurriedly
bolted into the corridor of one of the buildings—that in
which the rooms of the fortune-teller and long-time adventuress
were located.</p>

<p>Quickly mounting the stairs, Hyde unceremoniously
entered her rooms.</p>

<p>He found Vic Clayton, by which name he best knew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
her, seated alone in the reception-parlor, the maid employed
there having just gone out to lunch.</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Sandy!” she cried, starting up from her
chair when he entered.</p>

<p>When he eagerly advanced to clasp both her hands,
moreover, she drew him into her arms and kissed him,
as only lovers kiss.</p>

<p>“Break away!” he quickly protested, however.</p>

<p>“Well, well, what’s this?”</p>

<p>“As much as I like it, Vic, there’s no time for that.”</p>

<p>The woman’s eyes took on a startled look.</p>

<p>“No time!” she echoed, sharply regarding him.</p>

<p>“I should say not. There’s the devil to pay.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Or worse than the devil—that’s Nick Carter!”</p>

<p>“What of him?”</p>

<p>“He’s coming here again.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>The last came with vicious asperity from the lips of
the surprised woman.</p>

<p>The color had left her cheeks. The light of sensuous
affection, the bestowal of which had turned this man into
a knave, a traitor to his trust at police headquarters, and
made him her dupe and tool—this light of passion had
suddenly died from her eyes, displaced by the vengeful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
fire with which she had last parted from the man he
had just mentioned.</p>

<p>Darting to the door, Vic hurriedly turned the key,
then swept around, as quick and lithe as a panther in her
movements, and grasped Hyde by the shoulder.</p>

<p>“Not coming here now, not at once, is he?” she demanded,
in rapid whispers.</p>

<p>“Do you think I’m daffy, to be here, in that case?”
growled Sandy.</p>

<p>“Yet——”</p>

<p>“No, no; there’s time enough, Vic,” he interrupted.
“He’s not coming till two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“To ask you to go with him to the scene of the fake
hold-up.”</p>

<p>“That of the photograph?” gasped Vic, with hands
pressed to her breast and her white face drawn with increasing
apprehension.</p>

<p>“That’s what he said.”</p>

<p>“Has he detected something queer in that picture?”</p>

<p>“I reckon he has, Vic.”</p>

<p>“Do you know what he suspects?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t say,” replied Hyde. “Weston asked him,
but Carter only said that he’d keep the photograph for a
time.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>“Do you know for what?”</p>

<p>“I don’t.”</p>

<p>“Were there any names mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Only yours.”</p>

<p>“In the way you stated?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Anything more?”</p>

<p>“One thing—and a mighty significant one!” growled
Hyde, with a nod.</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>“He added that he would land our gang, every man
and woman of us, or throw up his job.”</p>

<p>“He said that, did he?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“The infernal meddler!”</p>

<p>“He has struck some clue, that’s dead sure!” declared
the spy. “It’s a condition that means we must get him,
Vic, or he’ll get us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, we’ll get him, all right!” Vic Clayton now cried,
with a venomous sneer. “If he’s coming for that, for
what you say, you let me alone to get him!”</p>

<p>Though her flood of questions had been asked with
passionate impatience, she now appeared more calm, yet
not less viciously determined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span></p>

<p>With a seductive smile, she now said warmly:</p>

<p>“You’re all right, Sandy. I’ll not forget this little
service, and you shall have your reward when——”</p>

<p>“I’ll get mine, all right, Vic, if the chief ever gets
wise to the game I’m playing,” interrupted Hyde, with a
mingled laugh and grimace.</p>

<p>“He will never learn of it.”</p>

<p>“If he does, Vic, I can see myself put through the
third degree in a way that will leave mighty little of
me.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“I’m taking mighty long chances in doing this for you,
and for——”</p>

<p>“Are you getting no reward for doing it, Sandy?”</p>

<p>The woman’s arm had stolen around his neck, while
her breath fell warm on his cheek with the interruption.
She drew him closer till her lips met his, then hurriedly
released him, saying quickly:</p>

<p>“Go, now, Sandy, and leave the rest to me.”</p>

<p>“You can handle the matter?” he lingered to inquire
anxiously.</p>

<p>“You bet I can handle it!”</p>

<p>“What will you do?”</p>

<p>“You leave that to me, I say.”</p>

<p>“You have no time to waste, Vic.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>“Is time not wasted in talk of this kind?” Vic impatiently
rejoined. “Go at once, I repeat, and leave the
rest to me.”</p>

<p>Hyde started for the door, only to have the woman
again dart across his path and clasp him by the arm.</p>

<p>“Stop a moment!” she cried, under her breath.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>The query came with a startled gasp, as Hyde, naturally
a nervous and cowardly cur, instinctively shrank
from the expression now risen over Vic Clayton’s face.</p>

<p>For there was murder in her dilated eyes, in her
deathly white features, in the vicious firmness of her
drawn, gray lips.</p>

<p>“There is something more!” she hissed, with suppressed
ferocity. “Have you been constantly watchful
at headquarters?”</p>

<p>“Have I? That’s a fat question for you to ask me,”
said Hyde. “You should know that I have.”</p>

<p>“So I do—so I do, Sandy, dear!” Vic hurriedly exclaimed,
in assuasive tones. “But there is one thing
more. Is Nick Carter alone in this case?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Are you sure of it—dead sure of it?” demanded
Vic, with a voice and aspect that plainly betrayed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
murderous design that inspired this precautionary question.</p>

<p>“Certainly I’m sure of it.”</p>

<p>“It will do us no good to down him, mind you, if
others at work with him are to rise up out of his ashes
and confound us with the same evidence that he may
possess.”</p>

<p>“There are no others,” protested Hyde confidently.
“If there were, Vic, I’d have told you.”</p>

<p>“Providing you knew it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’d have known it, all right,” declared Sandy.
“I’m never out of the office except to eat and sleep, and
I’d have been wise to it by this time if Carter had
brought on any of his assistants from New York.”</p>

<p>“You have heard none mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Not one.”</p>

<p>“This shows me the way, then—the one and only
way,” muttered the woman, staring for a moment at the
floor. “If it must be him or us—it shall not be us!”</p>

<p>“Carter has been at the chief’s office only twice, both
times alone,” added Hyde assuringly. “You may safely
gamble on it, Vic, that he’s still alone on the case.”</p>

<p>Again, with her vengeful countenance lighting for a
moment, she slipped her arm about the spy’s neck and
kissed him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>“Go, now, Sandy, and leave the rest to me,” she repeated.
“But come out to Badger’s place after dark
to-night.”</p>

<p>“To-night, Vic?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Shall I find you there?” queried Hyde, with wistful
gaze.</p>

<p>“Yes, you’ll find me there—and another with me!”</p>

<p>“Not Nick Carter?”</p>

<p>The woman’s brows knit again and her eyes gleamed
venomously.</p>

<p>“Nick Carter—yes!” she rejoined, with suppressed
ferocity. “Nick Carter—or what there is left of him!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.
<br />
<small>THE ROAD TO CANTON.</small></h2>


<p>It was precisely two o’clock when Nick Carter arrived
at Vic Clayton’s rooms in Tremont Street.</p>

<p>Naturally, Nick did not so much as dream that she had
been informed of his designs against her. That treachery
existed at police headquarters was farthest from
his thoughts.</p>

<p>In asking Vic Clayton to take him to the place where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
she and Claudia Badger claimed to have been robbed,
Nick had several motives.</p>

<p>To begin with, he wished to see if she would willingly
consent to do so.</p>

<p>Nick reasoned that, in case she readily consented, it
would indicate a bare possibility that he in some way
had misinterpreted the curious features that he had detected
in the photograph, and that the picture might not
be as incriminating in its significance as he had inferred.</p>

<p>While even this remote doubt existed, Nick felt that
he could not wisely make any very aggressive move in
the case, and he took this method to remove the doubt.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he hardly believed that Vic would
consent to comply with this request, but would evade it
with some plausible excuse.</p>

<p>Providing that she complied and went with him, however,
Nick believed that he could so corner her with
questions, while alone with her in a carriage, that he
could finally force from her a confession of the whole
business.</p>

<p>In any event, moreover, he felt sure that he could so
artfully take these steps that he would in no way sacrifice
any of his present advantages.</p>

<p>He found Vic Clayton alone in the handsomely furnished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
waiting-room, engaged in writing at an open desk
in one corner.</p>

<p>She had rearranged her hair and rouged her cheeks
since Sandy Hyde’s departure, and she looked, as a matter
of fact as well as of design, remarkably handsome
and attractive.</p>

<p>“Dear me!” she exclaimed, quickly dropping her pen
upon seeing Nick enter. “Is it you, Detective Carter?”</p>

<p>“None other,” bowed Nick, smiling.</p>

<p>“I’m delighted!” cried Vic, rising to offer her hand.
“I do hope you bring some encouraging news, or possibly
my lost gems themselves—despite that I predicted
only failure for you.”</p>

<p>The last was added with a fascinating laugh, in which
Nick was willing enough to join, though he found nothing
inviting in her seductive eyes and alluring airs.</p>

<p>“Well, hardly anything as favorable as that, Madame
Victoria,” he began.</p>

<p>“No, no, pardon me!” she interrupted, playfully tapping
him on the arm. “You surely do not call again
to consult me professionally?”</p>

<p>“No, I do not.”</p>

<p>“Then drop the Madame Victoria, my dear Mr. Carter,
which is much too strained for friendly intercourse,” she
softly cried, with an arch glance at him. “Let me be to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
you plain Miss Clayton—or even plain Victoria, so be it
that suits you even better.”</p>

<p>Nick experienced a vague feeling of distrust stealing
through him as he looked and listened, but in his ignorance
of what herein has been disclosed, he could find
no definite grounds for the feeling. Yet, instinctively, as
one sometimes dreads dangers still remote and visionary,
he did not fancy this woman’s bantering remarks nor
her playful attempts to captivate him.</p>

<p>Nick laughed again, nevertheless, and agreeably rejoined:</p>

<p>“As I told you the other day, Miss Clayton, it matters
little to me what I call you, providing you consent to
comply with my wishes.”</p>

<p>“Your wishes?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Dear me! I really think I should enjoy making them
my own, Detective Carter,” murmured Vic, with a pretty
cant of her head and a shrug of her shoulders.</p>

<p>“I trust so.”</p>

<p>“Have a chair.”</p>

<p>“Thanks.”</p>

<p>“Now what do you want of me this time, Detective
Carter?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>She had taken a seat near-by, still smiling archly at
him, and Nick more gravely answered:</p>

<p>“I want you to do me a little service.”</p>

<p>“You have only to name it.”</p>

<p>“I find you willing,” smiled Nick, a bit puzzled.</p>

<p>“The pleasure is all mine,” laughed Vic. “Yet I’m
really curious to know what you want of me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you. On what road was it, Miss Clayton, that
you and Mrs. Badger were held up by these rascally
highwaymen?”</p>

<p>“The road to Canton.”</p>

<p>“Are you familiar with it?”</p>

<p>“I’m familiar with that part of it,” cried Vic, with a
very significant smile and grimace. “Dear me! I shall
never forget it!”</p>

<p>“Quite vividly impressed upon your memory, eh?”</p>

<p>“Decidedly so, Detective Carter?”</p>

<p>“I suppose you could locate the precise spot, if there
was any occasion?”</p>

<p>“Indeed, I could. I know exactly where it is.”</p>

<p>“Ah, that is very fortunate,” said Nick agreeably. “I
wish to go out there and view the spot.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“I think I may discover some clue or sign, Miss Clayton,
either in the general appearance of the immediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
scene or the surrounding country, which might put me
on the track of the thieves,” Nick artfully rejoined, now
feeling that even this lame explanation could be made
to serve his purpose. “Of course,” he smilingly added,
“we detectives see much more in such cases than the untrained
eyes of a layman.”</p>

<p>“Naturally.”</p>

<p>“You see the point, do you not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” nodded Vic, with a demure stare at him.</p>

<p>“What do you think of it?”</p>

<p>“I’ll admit there might be something in it.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would,” Nick heartily replied. “Now
the question is, to get back to the service I require of
you. Will you go out there with me and show me the
spot?”</p>

<p>Vic burst out laughing, as if much amused.</p>

<p>“Is that all you want of me?” she cried.</p>

<p>“That is all just now,” said Nick, a bit dryly.</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Detective Carter, I’ll go with you,”
exclaimed Vic, as if a refusal was the last thing to have
been expected, or any occasion for one. “How shall we
go? It’s much too far to walk.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I should not think of asking you to walk,”
laughed Nick, somehow feeling again that he was on
deucedly thin ice, for which he could not account.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope not, my dear Mr. Carter.”</p>

<p>“I will provide a carriage.”</p>

<p>“What time do you wish to go?”</p>

<p>“The sooner the better, Miss Clayton. At once will
suit me best of all.”</p>

<p>Now Vic bridled a little, never other than crafty, and
her smiling face took on a look of regret.</p>

<p>“Dear me! That makes it a little bad,” she said, as
if weighing the situation. “I already had planned to
go to——Stay! here is a note to verify my making any
excuse, Detective Carter, after offering so volubly to
serve you.”</p>

<p>She reached over to the desk while speaking, taking
from it the note she had been writing, which she now
handed to Nick to be read.</p>

<p>It was merely a note to her maid, informing her that
she would be absent for a few hours, and that the girl
might close the rooms and take an outing until the
morrow.</p>

<p>“I had already planned to go riding, and was about
to leave that note for Delia, my maid,” she explained,
while Nick glanced at the craftily prepared missive.</p>

<p>“Well, that does interfere, Miss Clayton, as you say,”
he replied, eying her a bit sharply, yet failing to detect
any sign of duplicity, so artful was the jade. “If you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
cannot go with me to-day, however, possibly to-morrow
you——”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment!” exclaimed Vic, as if struck with a
second thought. “I was going only with Amos and his
wife, merely for a run of an hour or two, and——Hark!
that should be they!”</p>

<p>The toot of an automobile-horn had sounded from the
street below, and Vic sprang up while speaking, and ran
to look from the window.</p>

<p>“Yes, they are at the curb,” she added, with manifest
satisfaction. “Amos is coming up here. Now, if he has
no definite plans, Mr. Carter, I see no reason why we
cannot prevail upon you to——”</p>

<p>She was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Amos
Badger.</p>

<p>He bolted into the room like a man in a hurry, his
face flushed, his eyes bright, his voice resonant when impulsively
inquiring:</p>

<p>“All ready, Vic?”</p>

<p>Then he checked himself and exclaimed quickly, as if
unexpectedly beholding Nick in the room:</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Carter! You here? Glad to see you
again.”</p>

<p>“The pleasure is mutual, Mr. Badger,” replied Nick,
rising to accept the other’s proffered hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>“Thanks,” nodded Badger. “Have you got a line on
those infernal crooks yet?”</p>

<p>“No, not as yet.”</p>

<p>“Sorry to hear it.”</p>

<p>“But I’m hoping to do so.”</p>

<p>“I join you in the hope, Carter,” declared Badger; then
he laughingly added: “You’ll observe that I’m out of
those red flannel bandages.”</p>

<p>“Yes, so I see.”</p>

<p>“A nasty thing, a cold in the early summer.”</p>

<p>“So it is,” assented Nick. “I congratulate you upon
being rid of it.”</p>

<p>He had eyed the man intently while they were speaking,
and he saw what he had not seen, heard what he
had not heard, when they met at his place in Brookline;
for Badger now knew that he was suspected; knew what
desperate work must be done that afternoon, and he had
dropped those little artifices with which he had aimed
to blind Nick during their previous meeting.</p>

<p>In his clear and cutting voice, in every subtle, sinister
inflection, in the glowing glint of his dark eyes, in the
poise of his supple, muscular figure—in one and all of
these Nick now saw or heard again the man of the hold-up—as
plainly as when he saw the knave standing with
leveled weapons in that sunlit suburban road.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet the face of the detective did not change by so much
as a shadow, and Vic Clayton now interposed, with a
fine display of solicitude:</p>

<p>“We can do Mr. Carter a service, Amos, if you have
no plans for the afternoon.”</p>

<p>“How?” demanded Badger, turning quickly to her.</p>

<p>“He wishes to visit the place where Claudia and I were
held up and robbed, and he came here to ask me to go
with him. Now, if you have no particular trip you wish
to make to-day——”</p>

<p>“None whatever!” cried Badger, quickly interrupting.
“We are out for an airing only, and I’d as soon go that
way as any. The road to Canton—can you locate the
precise place, Vic?”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll take him out there at once, if he wishes,”
said Badger, quickly reverting to Nick. “What do you
say, Carter? There’s a seat in my auto, if you care
to go.”</p>

<p>Nick had foreseen what was coming, and had decided
what course to take.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ll go,” he said briefly.</p>

<p>“Good enough!” cried Badger. “Get into your wraps,
Vic, and we’ll start at once.”</p>

<p>Nick had seen, in fact, no wise alternative to accepting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
the offer. To have declined it, after the request he
had made Vic Clayton, might have aroused suspicions
which he had no reason to believe already existed. He
would take no chance of that before positive evidence
against these knaves had been secured.</p>

<p>That he had been betrayed from police headquarters,
that his suspicions and designs were already partly
known, that he was now up against a plot hurriedly arranged
by telephone, that he was the victim of an admirably
played game, that his life itself was in jeopardy from
that moment—only a clairvoyant could have seen all this.</p>

<p>Nick Carter was not a clairvoyant, however, nor had
he any reasonable cause for suspecting the real gravity
of his situation.</p>

<p>Yet with caution that was habitual to him when in the
company of persons known to be crooks, Nick became
more wary from the moment he took his seat in Badger’s
automobile.</p>

<p>It was a Packard four-cylinder motor-car, and Badger
was running the machine. With Nick beside him on
the front seat, and his wife and Vic Clayton behind, the
party of four were soon speeding through Brookline toward
the woodland roads of the famous Blue Hills.</p>

<p>Though the animated conversation that was sustained
meantime is not material here, it soon led Nick to form,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
in conjunction with the polite attentions bestowed upon
him, a new theory in explanation of the seemingly natural
situation.</p>

<p>“These crafty rascals are merely aiming to make a
favorable impression upon me with their courtesies,” he
said to himself, during a lull in the conversation.</p>

<p>“They are doing so in the hope of averting suspicion,
with a view to convincing me that they are as honest and
fashionable as they appear. They look and seem all
right. I’ll give them credit for that, and if I knew less
about them, I’m blessed if they wouldn’t fool me with
their pretensions.”</p>

<p>This soliloquy ran through Nick’s mind more than an
hour after they had started, but it was given the lie most
violently less than five minutes later.</p>

<p>The car was then speeding along a woodland road
in the Blue Hills, and Badger was bent forward over his
steering-wheel, apparently intent upon the road ahead.</p>

<p>As far as the eye could reach, the road was deserted.
One hundred yards ahead it divided, a branch road turning
off to the left.</p>

<p>The junction of the two was in the very midst of a
belt of woods, with no sign of a house or clearing in
sight.</p>

<p>After one swift, backward glance over her shoulder,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
Vic Clayton suddenly leaned forward and cried, above
the noise of the machine:</p>

<p>“You must take that road to the east, Amos. The
other leads to——”</p>

<p>“No, no, you’re wrong about that,” Badger quickly
called back over his shoulder.</p>

<p>“No, I’m not!”</p>

<p>“The west road leads to Canton.”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, Amos,” insisted Vic, in apparent
excitement, as the car rapidly approached the junction.
“We must take the east road. Mustn’t we, Claudia?”</p>

<p>Badger slowed down, as if in some uncertainty, then
brought the car to a stop just at the junction.</p>

<p>“Well, I am not really sure,” cried his wife, doubtfully
looking about—yet only to make sure that no other car
was in sight in any direction. “It’s all right, Amos——”</p>

<p>Badger was already upon his feet, interrupting her.</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” he exclaimed, while Nick glanced up with
a feeling of distrust. “If we take that road, Vic, it
will——Oh, I beg your pardon, Mr. Carter!”</p>

<p>Apparently by accident, while gesticulating about the
road, he had knocked Nick’s derby hat from his head.</p>

<p>Then, with a lightning like move, made as if to catch
the hat before it could fall to the ground, he threw himself<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
across the detective’s body, confining his arms to his
sides.</p>

<p>At that moment Vic Clayton had risen up in the car,
standing directly behind Nick.</p>

<p>“Now!” yelled Badger, with terrible ferocity.</p>

<p>There was no need for the command.</p>

<p>Already the uplifted hand of the fortune-teller was
descending; a hand fiercely gripping a clubbed revolver,
and thrice the butt of the heavy weapon fell squarely
upon Nick Carter’s unprotected head.</p>

<p>The tragic episode had been enacted in the fraction
of a second, before Nick could realize the design, much
less prevent it, and a single blow delivered as the three
had been would well-nigh have felled an ox.</p>

<p>Without so much as a groan, with every muscle suddenly
relaxing, Nick dropped inert and senseless upon
the floor of the car, his hair and brow turned crimson
by a swift gush of blood.</p>

<p>In an instant Badger was out upon the ground.</p>

<p>“Take my seat, Claudia,” he hurriedly cried to his
wife. “Lend me a hand here, Vic, and we’ll throw him
in behind. I’ll bind him hand and foot after we start
again. There, there, that will do! Now around with the
car, Claudia, and drive for home as if the devil followed
us!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>The transfer had been made in half a minute.</p>

<p>In another half the car was speeding back over the
woodland road at thirty miles an hour—heading for
Badger’s place near Brookline.</p>

<p>Senseless, between the seats, out of view of any persons
whom the speeding car might pass along the road,
lay the man for whom failure only had been predicted
by the desperate woman who had struck him down.</p>

<small>CLOSE QUARTERS.</small></h2>


<p>“It’s not for me to say what you’ll do or not do, since
you now appear to hold the ribbons. It’s up to you,
Badger, and not for me to say.”</p>

<p>The above came from Nick Carter several hours after
the tragic episode enacted in the woodland road.</p>

<p>Bound hand and foot, with his head rudely bandaged,
Nick sat propped against one of four stone walls, evidently
those of a small cellar, or possibly a wine-vault,
with but one heavy door through which the place was
accessible.</p>

<p>Only the bare earth was under him, damp and cold,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
while a small pool of stagnant water in one corner of
the place evinced the depressed location of the ground.</p>

<p>Two empty beer-kegs stood on end near-by.</p>

<p>On one of them a lantern was burning, the rays from
which shed only a dismal light over the more dismal
scene.</p>

<p>On the other keg sat Amos Badger, with his hands
on his knees, his lowering gaze fixed upon the helpless
detective, and his dark features wearing a look of mingled
satisfaction and sinister scorn.</p>

<p>It was then well into the evening, and Nick Carter had
with some difficulty been doctored back to consciousness,
and to a keen realization of his aching head and a most
unenviable situation.</p>

<p>The restoration had been accomplished by Conley, who
was somewhat of a veterinary physician, and it was no
sooner done than Badger hastened to interview his captive,
an interview only just begun when Nick made the
remark which opens this chapter.</p>

<p>“Up to me, is it?” returned Badger, with stern complacency.
“Up to me to say what shall be done with
you?”</p>

<p>“I cannot see that anything I say would be of weight,”
said Nick coolly.</p>

<p>“That’s right—it wouldn’t!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not at present.”</p>

<p>“No, nor later!” sneered Badger sharply. “You’ve had
your last say, Carter, now that we have you in our
clutches.”</p>

<p>“A very rascally game you played to accomplish it!”</p>

<p>“When you go hunting rascals, Carter, you must expect
to be turned down by their own methods, if at all.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too, and I was imprudent in not being
ready for you.”</p>

<p>“You were up against more craft and cunning than you
bargained for.”</p>

<p>“I don’t need to be informed of it,” retorted Nick, now
wondering when, how, and for what reason they had
planned the trick.</p>

<p>For he knew the assault must have been planned previous
to his talk with Vic Clayton that afternoon, or it
could not have been so quickly executed, nor the trap itself
so definitely arranged.</p>

<p>“One fact is now very obvious, however,” he presently
added, hoping to lead Badger into some inadvertent disclosure.</p>

<p>“What fact?” growled Badger, frowning at him.</p>

<p>“Some person informed you of the request I designed
to make the Clayton woman.”</p>

<p>“Think so?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>“Or informed her.”</p>

<p>“You’re getting wise fast.”</p>

<p>“Otherwise, Badger, you couldn’t have planned the job
among you,” continued Nick.</p>

<p>“Perhaps not.”</p>

<p>“I can come pretty near guessing who it was, too,
since Chief Weston is the only man I informed of my
intention.”</p>

<p>“Most likely he sent a messenger out here and warned
us,” sneered Badger, with a grin.</p>

<p>“Not he,” retorted Nick. “But there’s a red-headed
sketch and outline of a man in his office, Badger, whom
I’ll come pretty near rounding up along with the rest of
you, when I get out of this hole.”</p>

<p>“There will be no immediate rounding up, Carter,
since it depends upon you alone,” replied Badger, with a
searching stare at Nick’s face.</p>

<p>“Ah, then you were also told that I’m alone on the
case,” said Nick, willing enough to have him think so.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you alone on it?”</p>

<p>“If I’m not, Badger, you’ll hear from others soon
enough.”</p>

<p>“There are no others.”</p>

<p>“All right.”</p>

<p>“And you are now helpless.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not quite.”</p>

<p>“As good as down and out.”</p>

<p>“But I’m still in the ring,” insisted Nick.</p>

<p>“You’re in hands from which you’ll never escape alive,
I give you my word on that,” cried Badger, with menacing
austerity.</p>

<p>“Your word, Badger, is a poor voucher.”</p>

<p>“You now know far too much about us for us to let
you escape and disclose it,” added the latter decisively.
“I now want to know of just what your knowledge consists,
and what action you have taken against us.”</p>

<p>Nick laughed a bit derisively.</p>

<p>“I guess, Badger, you’ll have to take it out in wanting,”
said he.</p>

<p>“You’ll not inform me?”</p>

<p>“Not by a long chalk.”</p>

<p>“I shall find a way to compel you.”</p>

<p>“Possibly,” said Nick. “But you’ll have a long hunt
before you find the way.”</p>

<p>“You’ll let me alone to find that,” cried Badger, with
confident asperity. “I can devise tortures so acute that
even you will reveal what you have done toward——”</p>

<p>His rascally threat was interrupted at that point by
the sound of approaching steps from beyond the partly
closed door. In a moment it was thrown open, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
Jerry Conley, followed by Vic Clayton and Badger’s wife,
entered the dismal place.</p>

<p>That the two women were as low-bred and disreputable
as had been reported to Nick appeared in their utter
disregard of his wretched condition, and the malicious
satisfaction with which they stared at him, as they might
have stared at a caged beast which they had had occasion
to fear.</p>

<p>“You’ve got him back to earth, have you?” asked
Claudia, with a glance at Badger’s grim face. “Jerry
just came and told us, so we thought we’d have a look
at him.”</p>

<p>Vic Clayton, however, came and bent above Nick,
peering down at his stern features, now white from loss
of blood; while her own evil eyes, with the mocking
smile that curled her cruel lips, plainly evinced her
despicable and malignant nature.</p>

<p>“Well, you’ve got as many lives as a cat, haven’t you?”
she demanded, in taunting tones.</p>

<p>Nick returned her evil stare with hardly a change of
countenance, yet there was in his lifted eyes an ominous,
fiery gleam, from which those who knew him best had
learned to shrink with fear.</p>

<p>“I shall live long enough to repay with interest the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
blows you dealt me, and to land you where you belong?”
he sternly rejoined.</p>

<p>“You will, eh?” sneered Vic, with a derisive laugh.</p>

<p>“Without the slightest doubt.”</p>

<p>“Evidently you’ve forgotten what I predicted for you.”</p>

<p>“The predictions of a charlatan are seldom fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“Charlatan?”</p>

<p>“And crook,” added Nick.</p>

<p>“Don’t be saucy, Mr. Carter, not to a lady,” said the
frowning jade. “You’ll meet with just what I predicted
for you—failure.”</p>

<p>“I’ll risk that.”</p>

<p>“And you’re in a very fair way to it,” added Vic, with
a sinister nod, as she terminated her malicious scrutiny
and turned to Amos Badger.</p>

<p>The latter had drawn aside with his wife and Conley,
and the three stood talking in subdued tones, apparently
with no interest in the recent amusement of their confederate.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say?” demanded Vic, as she approached
them. “We’ve got him, all right. Now, what’s
to be done with him?”</p>

<p>“That’s what we are discussing,” growled Conley, who
had much of the ruffian in him. “I say ’twas a mistake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
not to have let him croak, if he’d have been accommodating
enough to do so.”</p>

<p>“Bah!” muttered Claudia. “Men with as hard heads as
his don’t die so easily.”</p>

<p>“To my way of thinking,” added Conley, “it’s safest
for us to put out his light at once, and be done with it.”</p>

<p>Badger, however, quickly shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not yet,” said he grimly. “Not before to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“But why the delay?” protested Conley. “I cannot see
anything in that.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll tell you why.”</p>

<p>“Well, out with it.”</p>

<p>Nick pricked up his ears, yet he could catch only a
word now and then louder than others.</p>

<p>“To begin with,” argued Badger, “I’m not going to
run my neck into a noose before I know just how we
stand. We have no blood on our hands as yet, and before
I take chances of that kind, Conley, I’m going to be
dead sure that Carter has not reported his suspicions
to Weston. What good will it do to put him out of the
way, only to find that we have half a score of Boston
detectives on our heels, to whom Carter’s discoveries
have been imparted.”</p>

<p>“But Sandy declares that Weston knows nothing about
that,” whispered Vic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>“I hope he doesn’t, but I’m going to be sure of it before
I wipe out Nick Carter,” said Badger.</p>

<p>“How can you make sure?” growled Conley.</p>

<p>“We shall know by to-morrow at this time.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“Because we shall have others after us, Jerry, just as
soon as the discovery is made that Carter is missing,”
reasoned Badger. “If none show up, we may then
safely assume that Sandy Hyde is right, and that Carter
has disclosed nothing definite. We shall then know that
he’s the only one we need fear, and it will then be time
enough to put him down and out.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s something in that,” Conley now muttered.</p>

<p>“We know he cannot escape.”</p>

<p>“H’m! I should say not.”</p>

<p>“So there’s no need of haste, since we have him in our
clutches,” added Badger. “Besides, there is another
thing to be considered.”</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“Carter may have some of his New York assistants
here, for all we positively know to the contrary.”</p>

<p>“Sandy says not,” interposed Vic.</p>

<p>“He may not be absolutely sure,” Badger argued.
“And until we are dead certain of it, which should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
by to-morrow at this time, I am resolved to take no
chance of some day being tried for murder.”</p>

<p>“That does have an ugly sound,” said Vic, with a dismal
grimace.</p>

<p>“And there’s an ugly penalty,” added her sister.</p>

<p>“So that settles it, Jerry,” said Badger. “We’ll keep
Carter right here till we know just what we’re up
against.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s good enough for me if ’tis for you,” said
Conley indifferently.</p>

<p>“Are you sure his bonds are secure?”</p>

<p>“If he loosens any of those knots, Amos, I’ll eat the
ropes,” was the confident rejoinder.</p>

<p>“To-morrow we’ll take steps to make him open his
mouth, and tell all he knows.”</p>

<p>“What steps?”</p>

<p>“I’ll find a way, let me alone for that.”</p>

<p>“Meantime——” began Vic.</p>

<p>“No more here,” interposed Badger. “It’s too infernally
damp and cold. Go back to the house, you two
women, and I’ll presently join you there. I’ll first make
sure that things here are all safe.”</p>

<p>“All right, Amos.”</p>

<p>The two women withdrew from the vault, Nick following
them with his gaze.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>The two men remained, and both now proceeded to
make doubly sure that the ropes binding Nick’s arms and
limbs were securely knotted.</p>

<p>Not a word was spoken.</p>

<p>The work required less than a minute, and Badger
then took up the lantern and signed for Conley to go out
ahead.</p>

<p>At the door of the vault, however, Badger turned
back for a moment, to say, with vicious assurance:</p>

<p>“If it is to be one of us who must go down and out,
Carter, it will be you! Take my word for that!”</p>

<p>For a moment Nick gazed sternly at him across the
dismal place, then coldly retorted:</p>

<p>“Since I have only your word for it, Badger, I feel
perfectly safe!”</p>

<p>Badger vented a half-smothered growl, then closed the
heavy door with a resounding bang.</p>

<p>Nick heard the shooting of bolts and the sound of a
bar dropped into place.</p>

<p>Then all was silence for a time—silence and darkness!</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.
<br />
<small>SHADOWS AND SHADOWED.</small></h2>


<p>“Thundering guns!” muttered Patsy. “He’d be an
ugly cur to meet in the dark.”</p>

<p>Chick Carter gazed in the direction indicated.</p>

<p>The two detectives were comfortably seated on a log
in the midst of a cluster of shrubbery.</p>

<p>The shrubbery formed a part of the scrub and bushes
skirting the woodland back of the extensive Badger
estate.</p>

<p>Nearly a hundred yards away was the stable, a side
view, with the long carriage-house adjoining, as previously
described.</p>

<p>Fifty yards beyond was the Badger dwelling, rear
elevation, with the back door and windows in plain sight,
as well as part of one of the side verandas.</p>

<p>The intervening ground was clear of trees, and nothing
obstructed the view of the two watching detectives.</p>

<p>They were executing Nick’s command given them that
morning, that of learning what they could about the
Badger place without being seen.</p>

<p>They had already measured it from in front, and had
arrived at their present vantage-point about half an hour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
before, bent upon watching till they were reasonably assured
as to the number of servants in the house and
stable.</p>

<p>Matters always moved lively with the Carters after a
trail was once fairly struck, and in this case they were
no exception.</p>

<p>That which had occasioned Patsy’s muttered exclamation
was now observed by Chick, who parted the shrubbery
concealing them to view the object a little better.</p>

<p>It was a huge Cuban bloodhound, a wicked-looking
beast. The animal had evidently just come out of the
stable, the front of which was only partly visible to the
detectives, and he was now trotting across the lawn toward
the rear door of the house.</p>

<p>“I believe you are right,” rejoined Chick. “He looks
as if he might bolt a man with a single mouthful.”</p>

<p>“Dead easy,” nodded Patsy.</p>

<p>“If we have work to do here after dark,” said Chick,
“we’d best keep that fellow in mind.”</p>

<p>“Rather.”</p>

<p>“He’d put up an uglier fight than the entire bunch
we’ve seen so far.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Chick.”</p>

<p>“We’ve seen only four as yet.”</p>

<p>“Badger and his wife, whom we saw from the front,”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
counted Patsy. “The middle-aged woman at work in
the kitchen yonder, and the covey we’ve seen about the
stable. That makes four, Chick; sure as you’re a foot
high.”</p>

<p>“I begin to think there are no others.”</p>

<p>“Four are not many to be carrying on the game Nick
suspects,” suggested Patsy, a bit doubtfully.</p>

<p>“There is still the Clayton woman,” replied Chick;
“and she and Badger’s wife may be as bold and capable
as men would be.”</p>

<p>“Very likely.”</p>

<p>“There are enough of them to have played this hold-up
game successfully, that’s plain enough; and the
smaller the number, Patsy, the less liability of betrayal.”</p>

<p>“That’s true, Chick.”</p>

<p>“I think that the paucity of servants here is a point
in our favor.”</p>

<p>“A point that Nick is right?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so.”</p>

<p>“I doubt if there are others,” repeated Chick, “or if
we can remain here much longer to advantage. We are
to rejoin Nick at four o’clock, you remember.”</p>

<p>“What time is it now?”</p>

<p>“Half-past one,” replied Chick, consulting his watch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>It was at that moment that Vic Clayton was receiving
her very important communication from the spy from
police headquarters, half an hour before the arrival of
Nick.</p>

<p>At the same moment, while Chick and Patsy were
crouched, gazing toward the house, Conley came out of
the rear door and sauntered toward the stable, lighting
his pipe while he walked.</p>

<p>“There’s that stable covey again,” murmured Patsy.
“I don’t half-fancy his looks.”</p>

<p>“Evidently he is just out from dinner.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing! See, the woman is now feeding the dog
at the back steps. That’s what the ugly cur trotted over
there for.”</p>

<p>“He knows when meal-time comes,” laughed Chick.</p>

<p>“Mebbe his meal-ticket is only good at this hour,”
grinned Patsy. “I wonder if that covey is the only man
in the stable. If he is, Chick, he must have a good bit
of work, or else Nick is away off on some points.”</p>

<p>“Why so?”</p>

<p>“Nick thinks they have three or four horses out here.”</p>

<p>“We know of one, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“And he thinks these hold-up crooks have several automobiles.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>“They don’t require much labor, particularly when only
seldom used.”</p>

<p>“Well, they haven’t the autos in that stable, nor in the
carriage-house,” declared Patsy. “That’s a cinch, Chick,
for we’ve had a look into both.”</p>

<p>“True.”</p>

<p>“And there’s only one horse in the stable.”</p>

<p>“They may have some secret place of concealment for
the whole business,” said Chick.</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, yet——”</p>

<p>“Stop a bit!” Chick suddenly interrupted, rising to
peer through the shrubbery. “What’s the meaning of
this?”</p>

<p>“Gee!” muttered Patsy, also starting to his feet.
“Something’s up!”</p>

<p>Though they had no way of learning the occasion for
the excitement at this time, both being out of hearing
and unable to approach without being detected, it was
at just this time that Badger received from Vic Clayton
a telephone communication concerning Nick Carter’s designs,
and which had been quickly followed by the laying
of the plot that later resulted in Nick’s downfall.</p>

<p>Badger had come plunging out of the back door of the
house, without coat or hat, throwing away his cigar as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
he ran across the lawn, all the while shouting lustily
to Conley.</p>

<p>It was his sudden appearance and obvious excitement
that had so startled both Chick and Patsy.</p>

<p>Conley turned back upon hearing the shouts, and the
two crooks met about twenty feet in front of the stable,
within plain view of the detectives.</p>

<p>There Badger talked rapidly for several moments, with
occasional fierce gestures in the direction of the city,
and all the while both men exhibited in their faces and
movements a consternation and excitement not easily to
be accounted for by one out of hearing.</p>

<p>“Gee! I’d give something to know what they are saying,”
muttered Patsy, staring with distended eyes.</p>

<p>“There is something in the wind,” nodded Chick.</p>

<p>At the end of about a minute, Badger turned and
rushed back to the house, entering it at the top of his
speed.</p>

<p>Conley, meantime, bolted out of sight toward the stable
door, yet not into it, which was out of view of the detectives.</p>

<p>“Where the dickens did he go?” said Chick curiously.</p>

<p>“It looked as if he went into the stable,” said Patsy.</p>

<p>“I’m not so sure of that.”</p>

<p>“No?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>“I thought he turned to one side just before he approached
the door.”</p>

<p>“He may have run around the farthest corner,” suggested
Patsy. “We might change our positions, Chick,
so as to see that door.”</p>

<p>“Wait a bit,” replied Chick. “There’s a big hurry here
over something, and we shall see all there is to be seen
in short order.”</p>

<p>“I guess that’s right.”</p>

<p>“Badger pointed toward town several times,” added
Chick, with grave countenance. “I’d wager a little that
Nick is in some way back of this, if not involved in some
bother.”</p>

<p>“You don’t imagine——”</p>

<p>“Easy! Here comes Badger again.”</p>

<p>Once more the latter had bolted out of the house, and
this time he was followed by his wife.</p>

<p>Now both had on their outside garments, and evidently
were prepared for a ride.</p>

<p>At the same moment an automobile, with a furious
rumble and whir, came into view in front of the stable,
and sped across the lawn to meet the couple.</p>

<p>It was driven by Conley, who tumbled out of it the
instant it stopped, while Badger and his wife clambered
in almost as quickly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>In another moment, with Badger running it, the car
was speeding down the long gravel driveway toward
Laurel Road.</p>

<p>The departure was made so excitedly and hurriedly
that Patsy, who had been holding his breath all the while,
now exhaled it with a sharp gasp.</p>

<p>“Whew; that beats the record,” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What puzzles me,” replied Chick perplexedly, “is
where that auto came from.”</p>

<p>“Gee! that’s just what I was thinking.”</p>

<p>“It did not come out of the stable, I’ll swear to that.”</p>

<p>“It looked to me as if it came around the farther corner.”</p>

<p>“It was a Packard,” said Chick. “I know the machine.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps——”</p>

<p>“Break off and follow me,” now interrupted Chick,
who had been watching Conley walk leisurely back toward
the stable.</p>

<p>“Where now?” asked Patsy, as they drew back through
the woods.</p>

<p>“Back to town,” said Chick decidedly. “There’s nothing
more for us here at present.”</p>

<p>“It’s a good bet that Badger has headed for town,
since he pointed that way so often.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span></p>

<p>“That’s just my idea, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about it?”</p>

<p>“I think that something has happened to alarm these
rascals,” replied Chick.</p>

<p>“And that nobody but Nick could have brought that
about?”</p>

<p>“Exactly.”</p>

<p>“In that case, Chick, he may have made some move
since we left him.”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And possibly these guys have got wise to it.”</p>

<p>“That appears to be about the size of it,” nodded
Chick. “Furthermore, it looks as if Badger, in making
this lightning trip, had got something up his sleeve for
Nick.”</p>

<p>“A counter-move?”</p>

<p>“Precisely.”</p>

<p>“What shall we do about it?”</p>

<p>“We’ll first make sure about Nick,” replied Chick.
“He was to rejoin us at four o’clock. If he doesn’t show
up at that hour, or a little later, we must get a move on.”</p>

<p>“To trace him?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“And if we fail to strike his trail?”</p>

<p>“Back out here we’ll come, Patsy, dog or no dog, to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
learn what this sudden journey really meant,” declared
Chick, with grave determination.</p>

<p>He had reasoned shrewdly in that he had attributed
Badger’s excited departure to some unexpected cause for
alarm, and also that Nick was the person most likely to
have occasioned it.</p>

<p>In the light of these deductions, moreover, Badger’s
immediate and decisive action plainly indicated that he
had some definite project in view, presumably one to
avert the impending danger.</p>

<p>The conclusions alone were sufficient to point to some
peril threatening Nick, and his chief assistant was quick
to arrive at them, and act accordingly.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, however, the celerity and astuteness
with which the Carters invariably cooperated in
their work went far toward insuring their success.</p>

<p>Chick’s talk with Patsy had occurred while they picked
their way through the belt of woods, from which they
presently emerged, then hastened to the nearest trolley
line and back to the city.</p>

<p>It was nearly three o’clock when they arrived at the
Adams House, and went to Nick’s room.</p>

<p>There was no sign of Nick, however.</p>

<p>The magnifying-glass with which he had examined<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
the incriminating photograph was still lying on the table
where he had left it. But there was neither note nor
token to show that he had been there since the three departed
in company that morning.</p>

<p>“He has not returned since he left with us, Patsy,” said
Chick, after looking about. “We’ll wait till the appointed
hour.”</p>

<p>“Four o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Or a little later.”</p>

<p>“He may show up by that time.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t much hope of it,” replied Chick, a bit
anxiously. “I’ve got it on me good and hard, a genuine
hunch, Patsy, that something has gone wrong with
him.”</p>

<p>“You’re most generally right, Chick, when you feel
like that.”</p>

<p>Chick made no reply, but began pacing the floor.</p>

<p>An hour passed, and brought no sign of Nick.</p>

<p>At half-past four Chick could restrain his impatience
no longer.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he abruptly exclaimed, catching up his
hat. “We’ll get a move on.”</p>

<p>Patsy started up from the couch, on which he was
having a pull at his pipe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>“I’m with you!” he cried, with alacrity. “Going to try
to trace him?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Where first, Chick? To State Street?”</p>

<p>“It’s too late to go there,” replied Chick, as they left
the room and hastened toward the elevator.</p>

<p>“Yet we might strike his trail there.”</p>

<p>“I can do so more quickly, I think.”</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“At police headquarters—Chief Weston’s office, in
Pemberton Square.”</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.
<br />
<small>ON NICK’S TRAIL.</small></h2>


<p>It was five o’clock when Chick and Patsy entered Pemberton
Square.</p>

<p>It was about half an hour before that when Nick Carter
was lodged in his place of confinement.</p>

<p>“You wait here, Patsy,” said Chick, at the corner on
which Nick engaged Grady’s runabout a few mornings
before. “There is no need of both of us going into the
chief’s office. I’ll return inside of five minutes.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead.”</p>

<p>Chick hastened down the basement stairs and into the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
chief’s office—only to encounter Sandy Hyde just entering
from the opposite corridor.</p>

<p>“Where’s the chief?” Chick cried bruskly.</p>

<p>Hyde didn’t know Chick from a side of sole leather,
but, knowing at least that he was not Nick Carter, he
answered quite promptly:</p>

<p>“The chief is in his office.”</p>

<p>“I must see him.”</p>

<p>“What name?”</p>

<p>“Chick Carter. Come, come, I’m in a rush!”</p>

<p>Hyde’s catlike eyes at once began to dilate upon hearing
the name, taking on their greenish glow of internal
excitement.</p>

<p>He now realized that he had given Vic Clayton a
wrong tip, that one of Nick’s assistants was in Boston
and on the case with him, and the servile little rascal at
once began to figure how he could square himself and
discover Chick’s mission.</p>

<p>He did not dare hazard playing the eavesdropper
again, and also feared that he might not overhear all
that was said by so doing, and he at once adopted the
first resort that appealed to him.</p>

<p>He hastened through the enclosure, and into Weston’s
private office, saying quickly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>“There’s a man out here to see you, chief.”</p>

<p>“What man?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t catch his name, sir. But he’s in an awful
rush, and I reckon something has happened.”</p>

<p>Just as Hyde had expected, Chief Weston started up
from his chair and strode into the general office.</p>

<p>Hyde was cunning enough to foresee that, if Chick
was in such great haste, their conversation would probably
be carried on in the outer office.</p>

<p>So it was, moreover, despite that Weston at once cried,
as he shook his visitor by the hand:</p>

<p>“Why, hello, Chick Carter! How are you? Come
inside.”</p>

<p>“No, no, chief,” Chick quickly declined. “I’m going
to stay but a moment. Has Nick been here to-day?”</p>

<p>“Yes—about one o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where he has gone?”</p>

<p>“I know where he said he was going.”</p>

<p>“Where was that?”</p>

<p>“To Madame Victoria’s rooms, in Tremont Street,”
replied Weston.</p>

<p>“Do you know for what?” inquired Chick, beginning
to see light ahead.</p>

<p>Chief Weston briefly told him of what Nick’s mission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
at Vic Clayton’s rooms consisted, as stated by Nick, and
then he inquired curiously:</p>

<p>“Why are you asking about him, Chick? Is there
anything wrong?”</p>

<p>Having learned all that he could then and there, however,
Chick decided to impart nothing at this time.</p>

<p>“No, nothing wrong, chief, I think,” he quickly rejoined,
turning to go. “I am merely in a hurry to locate
him, that’s all. He may have returned to the hotel by
this time.”</p>

<p>“I think likely you’ll find him there,” nodded Weston,
a bit suspicious of Chick’s evasion.</p>

<p>Chick did not wait longer, but bolted out as he had
bolted in.</p>

<p>Weston walked toward his private office.</p>

<p>Hyde’s greenish eyes, now glowing more brightly
than ever, drifted toward the telephone-closet.</p>

<p>Before he could make a move to convey the desired
warning to Badger, however, Chief Weston turned back
and said curtly:</p>

<p>“You come in here with me, Sandy. I want you to
help me on my quarterly report for an hour or so. Look
lively, too, or you’ll be tied up here till after six o’clock.”</p>

<p>The sallow features of the treacherous miscreant quivered
and twitched with disappointment for a moment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
but immediate obedience was imperative—and the telephone
had to wait!</p>

<p>Chick Carter rejoined Patsy on the corner.</p>

<p>“Come on!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p>“Where now?” inquired Patsy, as they headed for
Tremont Street.</p>

<p>“To the fortune-teller’s rooms.”</p>

<p>“Has Nick been there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, about two o’clock.”</p>

<p>“Did you learn for what?”</p>

<p>“All that Weston could tell me,” replied Chick, hurriedly
informing him what he had learned.</p>

<p>Both were quick to see the possibilities which their
various observations and discoveries presented, and Patsy
now forcibly declared, as Chick concluded:</p>

<p>“I’ll bet that some kind of a scurvy trick has been
turned.”</p>

<p>“I fear so, Patsy.”</p>

<p>“Badger wouldn’t have been on such a rush with that
auto unless he had some scheme in view.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” assented Chick. “Madame Victoria
may have telephoned to him what Nick was about doing,
and possibly planned with Badger to get him into
their hands.”</p>

<p>“That appears about the size of it. If we get no trace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
of him here,” growled Patsy, “we’ll go out there again
to-night and investigate.”</p>

<p>“That’s what we’ll do.”</p>

<p>“Do you know just where the fortune-teller’s rooms
are located?”</p>

<p>“Yonder,” nodded Chick, as they hastened up Tremont
Street. “In that block on the next corner.”</p>

<p>“What are you going to ask her, in case she is there?”</p>

<p>“Oh, I can give her some kind of a plausible story
to explain my inquiries,” replied Chick confidently.
“She’s not clairvoyant enough to see through me, I’ll go
my pile on that.”</p>

<p>“Mine goes the same way,” vouchsafed Patsy, with a
grin.</p>

<p>“I’ll assuredly not let her know that I’m on the case
with Nick,” added Chick. “If these rascals think he is
working it alone, we may derive some advantage by
keeping them in the dark.”</p>

<p>“Surely.”</p>

<p>“Nick also may not wish us to expose that we, too, are
investigating the case——Stop a bit! Wait here!”</p>

<p>Chick had suddenly caught Patsy by the arm and
drawn him to the shelter of a doorway, less than twenty
yards from that leading into the building occupied by
Vic Clayton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>The occasion for this move was obvious.</p>

<p>Just turning the corner of Boylston Street, and approaching
the building mentioned, was a huge touring-car
of the latest type, occupied by two women only.</p>

<p>“By thunder!” muttered Patsy excitedly. “That’s Badger’s
wife running that car.”</p>

<p>“I see it is,” said Chick more coolly.</p>

<p>“With the fortune-teller?”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it. She answers Nick’s description of
her.”</p>

<p>“Gee whiz!”</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“That’s not the car that Badger and his wife used
this afternoon,” cried Patsy.</p>

<p>“So I see,” said Chick, still watching the couple.
“There is something back of all this.”</p>

<p>“You bet there is!”</p>

<p>“Hold your horses, however, till I see what the two
women are about to do.”</p>

<p>With skillful hands Claudia Badger had turned the
huge car in Tremont Street, then brought it to a stop
at the curb opposite the doorway giving ingress to Vic
Clayton’s rooms.</p>

<p>Then both women deliberately alighted and entered the
building, leaving the automobile unattended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span></p>

<p>Chick Carter’s eyes took on a sudden bright gleam.</p>

<p>They had lighted upon a large willow hamper, or covered
basket, attached to the rear of the car for the purpose
of stowing away articles to be carried on a long
tour. The hamper was nearly as large as a small trunk,
and the top was secured only with two brass clasps.</p>

<p>“By Jove, Patsy, here’s the chance of a lifetime!”
Chick hurriedly exclaimed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” came the eager inquiry.</p>

<p>“Do you see that hamper?”</p>

<p>“Sure!”</p>

<p>“Do you think you can get into it?”</p>

<p>Patsy needed no further hint to the design in Chick’s
mind, nor to the possibility it presented. With eyes
quickly glowing with eagerness and excitement, he hurriedly
replied:</p>

<p>“Get into it? Sure I can! The scheme is a corker!
It’ll take me right into the midst of these rascals. Come
on, Chick, and——”</p>

<p>“Stop a moment,” cautioned Chick. “Get that policeman
to help you, explaining who you are, and have
him take away any stuff that may be in the hamper.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll rush up-stairs, and keep those two women engaged
till I’m sure you are well under cover.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<p>“Good enough!”</p>

<p>“And to-night you can count on me to lend a hand,”
added Chick, “in case I am needed.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” cried Patsy.</p>

<p>“Away with you, then, while I tackle the two women.”</p>

<p>Patsy hastened toward the deserted automobile, near
which a policeman happened to be standing, and whose
aid the former quickly obtained in the way Chick had
suggested.</p>

<p>Chick, meantime, hastened into the building and up to
the rooms of Madame Victoria.</p>

<p>He found the two women in the reception-parlor, Vic
Clayton engaged in changing her automobile coat for
a long cloak.</p>

<p>They had driven into town again, after securing Nick,
only in order that they might be seen by the occupants
of the stores near-by, with a view to subsequently obtaining
the testimony of these observers, if the need
arose, in support of some plausible story to the effect
that they had brought Nick back to town and left him in
some locality.</p>

<p>Upon hearing Chick enter the room, both women
turned toward him with looks of surprise.</p>

<p>“I beg pardon, ladies,” said he, bowing. “I am looking
for Madame Victoria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>“I am she,” replied Vic, sharply regarding him.</p>

<p>“My name is Henderson, madame.”</p>

<p>“What can I do for you, Mr. Henderson?”</p>

<p>“I am looking for a gentleman who is said to have
been here this afternoon, and with whom I have important
business,” explained Chick, with a deliberation
well calculated to give Patsy what time he would require
below.</p>

<p>He was quick to see, however, the suspicious gleam
that instantly arose in Vic Clayton’s eyes upon learning
his business, and he added, with some suavity:</p>

<p>“I am unable to find the gentleman at his hotel, madame,
and I thought he might still be here.”</p>

<p>“Who is the gentleman?” asked Vic, with affected indifference.</p>

<p>“His name is Nick Carter.”</p>

<p>“Is he a friend of yours?”</p>

<p>“An acquaintance only.”</p>

<p>“How did you learn that he had been here, Mr.
Henderson?” inquired Vic, now bestowing a gracious
smile upon her questioner.</p>

<p>“I was so informed by the clerk at the hotel, to whom
Mr. Carter had mentioned his intention of coming
here.”</p>

<p>“Ah. I see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>“I inferred that Mr. Carter came here to consult you
professionally, madame, and I thought his interview
might possibly have lasted till now.”</p>

<p>Chick easily detected the relief which his artful explanation
had occasioned both women, and it convinced
him that he was on the right track, yet he in no way
betrayed his convictions.</p>

<p>Neither woman had approached the window to look
out, and Vic Clayton had now buttoned her cloak and
appeared anxious to depart.</p>

<p>Chick knew that Patsy must have accomplished his
design by this time, however, and he did not care how
soon the interview terminated.</p>

<p>“Well, Mr. Henderson, I cannot say where Mr. Carter
has gone,” Vic carelessly rejoined. “We dropped him
at the corner of Arlington Street, however, only a short
time ago.”</p>

<p>“From your automobile?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>“Possibly, then, I shall now find him at the hotel.”</p>

<p>“I think it quite probable, sir, for he walked toward
Washington Street after he left us,” smiled Vic, edging
toward the door which Claudia Badger already had
opened.</p>

<p>“I will return there and see,” said Chick, bowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
himself from the room. “Thank you very much for
your information.”</p>

<p>“Don’t mention it, sir,” replied Vic, with a little laugh,
as she and her companion also stepped into the corridor,
closing the door behind them.</p>

<p>Chick politely stepped aside, and let them precede
him down the stairs.</p>

<p>Without so much as a glance at him again, both women
fell into a conventional talk as they descended toward the
street.</p>

<p>Chick reached the sidewalk close upon their heels,
however.</p>

<p>The touring-car still stood at the curb—but there was
no sign of Patsy in any direction.</p>

<p>The policeman was lingering near-by, with an air of
indifference and a vacant stare across the opposite Common.</p>

<p>From some little distance away a few curious observers
were gazing toward the car, wondering at what they had
seen, but the officer had made sure that they were too
remote to attract attention.</p>

<p>Neither woman noticed them as she crossed the sidewalk
and quickly entered the car.</p>

<p>In another moment it was under way, with Claudia<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
Badger at the wheel, and presently was speeding up
Boylston Street.</p>

<p>Chick now turned to the policeman, who received him
with a significant grin.</p>

<p>“What do you say, officer?” demanded Chick.</p>

<p>“He’s in it, all right, sir,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“In the hamper?”</p>

<p>“That’s what.”</p>

<p>“Was it empty?”</p>

<p>“Not a thing in it, sir.”</p>

<p>“Close quarters for him, weren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Rather,” laughed the officer. “But he fixed the clasps
so he can get out whenever he likes, and he’ll not fare
so badly. What’s the job, Mr. Carter?”</p>

<p>“If all works well, officer, you may learn by reading
to-morrow morning’s newspapers,” Chick pointedly rejoined,
as he turned to go. “I cannot wait to inform
you, for I now have work of my own elsewhere.”</p>

<p>He was thinking of Badger’s place, and of what might
befall the dauntless young detective then speeding out
there in the hazardous manner described.</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, however, with a revolver in each
hip pocket, Chick also was on his way to Brookline.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.
<br />
<small>A TERRIBLE PREDICAMENT.</small></h2>


<p>Patsy held his breath.</p>

<p>It was a novel and, at times, a thrilling sensation, that
of riding at thirty miles an hour enclosed in a wicker
hamper on the rear of an automobile.</p>

<p>At times the car ran smoothly and swiftly; at others
it jolted heavily over a rougher road.</p>

<p>It was not dark in the basketlike receptacle into which
Patsy had fairly crammed himself, yet the wickerwork
was so compact that he could not see out unless he raised
the cover, and that he did not venture to do.</p>

<p>Neither could he hear anything that was said by the
two women on the front seat of the car, owing to the
constant noise of the vehicle.</p>

<p>He knew, however, that he was on the road to Badger’s
place, and speeding to the assistance of Nick Carter, and
that was good enough for Patsy up to that time.</p>

<p>After half an hour’s run, as nearly as he could judge,
the cramped and twisted young detective felt the car
sweep in a swift curve out of the direct road it had
been following, and speed along a much less smooth and
even way.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>“We have entered Laurel Road,” he rightly conjectured.
“In five more minutes we should arrive at
Badger’s house. Providing that I am not discovered in
this infernally tight box, I there may hear something to
serve my purpose. If I can learn definitely that Nick is
out here, and then discover just where he is located, the
rest of the job should be fairly easy.”</p>

<p>For his own peril, let it be what it might, the brave
youngster had not even a passing thought.</p>

<p>Presently the car turned again, and began to slow
down, and a moment later, when the noise of the motor
abated, Patsy could plainly hear Vic Clayton addressing
her companion.</p>

<p>“There is Amos on the side veranda, Claudia,” she
cried, in satisfied tones.</p>

<p>“So I see, Vic,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Things must still be all right out here, old girl, since
he appears to be taking it easy, and is smoking a
cigar.”</p>

<p>“I will round that side of the house before running
the car to the stable,” said Claudia.</p>

<p>“You can drop me there, too.”</p>

<p>“We’ll both stop there, and let Amos put the car under
cover. Yes, I judge that things are all right out here,
as you say.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>“They’ll soon take a turn for the worse, I’ll wager my
life on that,” thought Patsy, with grim anticipations.</p>

<p>It was then nearly seven o’clock, and the dusk of the
early evening had begun to fall.</p>

<p>As the car approached the side veranda and came to
a stop, Badger rose out of a chair in which he was seated,
and strode to the steps leading down to the driveway.</p>

<p>Though his dark features wore a look of evil complacency,
he at once addressed his wife in rather uneasy
tones.</p>

<p>“Well, what’s the verdict?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing wrong, Amos,” she cried, as both women
came down from the car.</p>

<p>“Did you stop at your rooms, Vic?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” laughed the latter. “Don’t you notice that
I have changed my coat?”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes, I see.”</p>

<p>“I did that only to indicate that we had some motive
for visiting the rooms,” she glibly added. “We had a
visitor, too, while we were there.”</p>

<p>“Who was that?”</p>

<p>“A chap named Henderson.”</p>

<p>“Henderson?”</p>

<p>“That’s what he said, Amos, and whom do you think
he inquired after?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>“Not Nick Carter!” cried Badger, with brows quickly
knitting.</p>

<p>“None other.”</p>

<p>“The devil you say! There may be something back
of that.”</p>

<p>“Nothing that involves us, I reckon,” declared Vic
confidently.</p>

<p>“Why do you feel so sure of it?”</p>

<p>“Because he was sent to my rooms by the clerk in the
hotel where Carter was stopping, and to whom he had
mentioned coming to my place. He merely wanted to
see him on business, Amos, and couldn’t locate him.”</p>

<p>The last was said with much significance and a loud,
derisive laugh, in which Amos Badger now joined.</p>

<p>“Not locate him, eh?” he cried, with a shrug. “Well,
if anybody locates him after to-morrow, Vic, I’ll take a
permanent seat in the back row.”</p>

<p>As may be inferred, this conversation took place some
little time before the interview with Nick himself, as related
in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>“You’ll take a seat in that stone hotel in Charles
Street, you mean, along with all the rest of us,” Vic
bluntly rejoined.</p>

<p>“You’ll soon be there!” thought Patsy, who was listening
intently to all that was being said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>Not so much as a glance had been bestowed upon the
hamper, which externally presented no unusual appearance,
and Patsy felt tolerably safe in his concealment.</p>

<p>The end was not yet, however.</p>

<p>“What have you done with him, Amos?” Claudia now
asked, as Badger came down the steps to run the car
to cover.</p>

<p>“With Carter?”</p>

<p>“Yes, of course. We started for town, you know,
the moment we had him safely landed here.”</p>

<p>“Conley now has charge of him,” said Badger.</p>

<p>“Where?”</p>

<p>“In the old wine-vault.”</p>

<p>“Are you going to confine him there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, till I do worse to him.”</p>

<p>“Has he come to himself?”</p>

<p>“Not yet,” Badger promptly replied. “Those were
three ugly blows that Vic gave him.”</p>

<p>“I was taking no chances by falling short of my
duty,” put in Vic, with a cruel laugh.</p>

<p>“They’d have killed him for sure, Vic, if his head were
not as tough and hard as a darky’s.”</p>

<p>“He would then have been out of our way, at all
events.”</p>

<p>“Conley will soon have him revived, I think, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
we will have a talk with him, and force him to confess
what is being done against us,” added Badger, approaching
the automobile. “I’ll stow the machine while you
two go in and eat your dinner. It’s already on the
table.”</p>

<p>“Had yours?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Send Jerry in here to tell us when his patient revives,”
called Vic Clayton, as she mounted the steps.
“I want to go out there and have a look at him.”</p>

<p>“All right,” growled Badger, as he sprang into the
car.</p>

<p>Then the two women entered the house.</p>

<p>In another moment the car started again with a whir
and rumble, and Patsy mentally sized up the situation
as he saw it.</p>

<p>“We have hit the nail on the head, all right,” he said
to himself. “These crooks are all that we have suspected,
and they have Nick imprisoned out here, after
knocking him on the head. They shall be paid with interest
for the blows given him, however, as surely as the
sun sets in the west.</p>

<p>“Confined in the old wine-vault, eh? I wonder where
that is located. Evidently it is not connected with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
cellar of the house, since that she devil of a fortune-teller
wants to go ‘out’ somewhere to see Nick.</p>

<p>“Conley, plainly enough, is the stableman we saw
to-day, and, since he has Nick in charge, it’s a good bet
that the vault mentioned is either in the basement of
the stable or that long carriage-house which adjoins it.
I’ll wager that I speedily find it, give me half a chance.”</p>

<p>“Hello! what’s the meaning of this?”</p>

<p>Patsy had suddenly felt the car lurch heavily, and
sway to one side, then plunge forward as if it were going
down a steep incline.</p>

<p>“We cannot be going directly into the stable,” he
quickly reasoned. “The run into that is on the level, but
we’re descending some short, steep place.”</p>

<p>“By Jove! I have it. Badger is taking the car into
some place from which Conley brought that one this
noon, which Chick felt sure had not come out of the
stable. These crooks must have some secret hiding-place
for their several cars and horses, and Badger is
about taking this one into it. Fortunately, I shall now
know all about it.”</p>

<p>Patsy was correct in these conjectures.</p>

<p>Badger had run the car around a corner of the stable,
then down to a short fence enclosing the space below the
building, which stood on a slope of the land.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>In this fence was a door about wide enough to admit
the car, and Badger quickly sprang down to open it.</p>

<p>As the latter did so, there fell upon Patsy’s ears a
sound that chilled his blood, despite the strong nerves
and invincible courage of the young detective.</p>

<p>The sound was the sudden threatening barking of a
dog, then confined in this basement garage.</p>

<p>“By thunder! it’s that Cuban bloodhound!” was Patsy’s
mental exclamation.</p>

<p>He felt a thrill of dismay when he now recalled the
huge beast, which he had not once thought of since
undertaking the hazardous venture in which he was at
present helplessly launched.</p>

<p>“If I escape detection by his ugly nostrils I shall be
lucky,” he said to himself. “If he scents me before I
can make some kind of a move to escape from this
basket, I shall be a gone goose for sure.”</p>

<p>These thoughts passed quickly through Patsy’s mind
while Badger was opening the door mentioned.</p>

<p>Then out came the dog, nearly as large as a small
calf, leaping about his rascally master, and barking furiously.</p>

<p>“Gee whiz! that’s a pleasant sound,” murmured Patsy,
with an irrepressible shudder.</p>

<p>“Down, Pluto!” roared Badger angrily. “Keep down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
I say! Close that trap of yours, you brute, or I’ll break
every bone in your ugly body. Get out, you cur!”</p>

<p>With the last of these exclamations, the huge dog was
dealt a resounding kick in the ribs, which sent him
yelping out across the lawn, at which Patsy breathed a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>“I’m safe for a few minutes, at least,” he decided.</p>

<p>Then he heard Badger shout commandingly:</p>

<p>“Here you, Conley! Come here with the lantern, so
I can see to run in this car. Look lively, old pal!”</p>

<p>Patsy wondered why he had shouted so lustily, and
now he ventured to raise the wicker lid about half an
inch and peer out.</p>

<p>A dimly lighted basement met his gaze. It was not
more than twenty feet square, with the stone foundation
walls of the stable on two sides, the open door on a
third, while the fourth and interior side appeared to be
a solid wooden bulkhead.</p>

<p>The floor was the bare ground, and the place was evidently
designed for stowing away an automobile.</p>

<p>“This is where that car came from this noon, that’s
plain enough,” thought Patsy. “Yet Nick must be wrong
in thinking the rascals own so many cars, for I’ve seen
only two. There’s not room in there for more than that
number.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>The last thought had barely crossed his mind, however,
when Patsy discovered his mistake, and also why
Badger had shouted so loudly.</p>

<p>A secret sliding door in the interior bulkhead wall suddenly
flew open, revealing a long extension of the basement,
running even under the carriage-house adjoining
the stable above.</p>

<p>In this secret extension, which was so cleverly constructed
as to defy detection either from within or without,
Patsy now caught sight of half a score of motors
lined up against one of the side walls, each of a different
make from the others, and all apparently in first-class
condition.</p>

<p>“By thunder! this does settle it, and Nick was right,”
he mused. “Those are the different cars these knaves
have used for their night hold-ups. This exterior basement
is only a blind for concealing the other.”</p>

<p>The chief figure that at once claimed Patsy’s attention,
however, was that of Jerry Conley.</p>

<p>He had appeared in the secret doorway in response to
Badger’s shout, and he carried in one hand a lighted
lantern, and in the other a flask of brandy.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you say, Jerry?” demanded Badger,
as the other strode out to join him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’s all right now,” growled Conley, setting down
the lantern.</p>

<p>“Got him back to earth?”</p>

<p>“Pretty nearly. He’ll be himself in a few minutes.”</p>

<p>“Thank God!” thought Patsy fervently. “That refers
to Nick.”</p>

<p>“Then he’ll not croak?” inquired Badger, as if somewhat
disappointed.</p>

<p>“Not this time; though I reckon ’twould be a good
thing for us if he did,” snarled Conley.</p>

<p>“Help me run this car in, then I’ll go and have a talk
with him.”</p>

<p>Patsy ducked his head and dropped the hamper lid.</p>

<p>Then he sensed that the two men had seized the sides
of the car and drawn it well into the exterior basement.</p>

<p>“Things all right in town?” queried Conley.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Did both women come out?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“I’m thinking ’twould be a good scheme to hold up
some party to-night,” Conley now declared.</p>

<p>“Why so?” inquired Badger.</p>

<p>“It would go to show the police that the unknown
road robbers have not been interfered with by any move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
of Nick Carter, and when he is found to be missing, no
suspicion, naturally, would fall upon us.”</p>

<p>“There’s something in that.”</p>

<p>“Sure there is.”</p>

<p>But Badger presently shook his head.</p>

<p>“Not to-night, Jerry,” said he decisively. “We already
have enough on for to-night with this infernal detective.
Besides, I’m about all in, with what I’ve had to
do to-day.”</p>

<p>“I don’t much wonder,” grinned Conley.</p>

<p>“We’ll cut out the hold-up until to-morrow,” added
Badger. “You go over to the house and tell Vic that
Carter has revived. She wants to come out and see him.
Meantime, I’ll take the lantern, and go and have a talk
with him.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with lighting this wall lamp?”</p>

<p>“No harm in it, Jerry. Light it, if you like.”</p>

<p>Badger took up the lantern while speaking, and strode
into the interior basement, closing the sliding door after
him.</p>

<p>Conley struck a match and lighted an oil-lamp in a
bracket on the wall, then hastened out of doors and
across the lawn.</p>

<p>“Now is my time!” thought Patsy. “If I can get into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
that inner cellar, and down Amos Badger, the rest will
be dead easy!”</p>

<p>He raised his head a little to lift the lid of the hamper.</p>

<p>Then he suddenly stopped, holding his breath.</p>

<p>The patter of soft feet on the ground near-by had
reached his ears.</p>

<p>Then came a furious sniffing about the wickerwork of
the hamper.</p>

<p>It was followed immediately by a long, low, threatening
growl, enough to have sent a chill through a brass
image.</p>

<p>“That infernal bloodhound again!” thought Patsy,
with an ugly creeping of his every nerve. “By thunder!
this is worse than being headed off by a man—or by half
a dozen men! What’s the cursed brute about to do?”</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">

<small>A CRISIS.</small></h2>


<p>The bloodhound continued to sniff and growl.</p>

<p>Patsy continued to lie low and hold his breath.</p>

<p>He knew that if he showed himself in the open there
would be trouble from that moment—and the worst kind
of trouble.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>He hoped that the fierce brute would presently have
satisfied his curiosity, and then take it into his ugly head
to return out of doors.</p>

<p>But the dog did nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>Plainly enough, he knew that there was something
wrong, and his watch-dog instinct impelled him to hang
about the suspected spot.</p>

<p>He fell to trotting to and fro near the back of the
touring-car, over a space of some six feet, like an irritated
lion in a cage.</p>

<p>With every turn he made he looked up at the hamper
with his rolling red eyes, and indulged in a low, threatening
growl.</p>

<p>It was as much as to say: “Don’t come out, or I’ll
make a meal of you!”</p>

<p>His huge jaws hung apart and were froth-flecked, and
Patsy, venturing once to peer out at him, did not like his
looks.</p>

<p>“He’d make mince-meat of me in less than ten seconds
if I undertook to leap out there,” he said to himself,
with gruesome misgivings. “Yet if I remain here
and he there, I am as good as discovered by these
crooks. I’m blessed if this hasn’t developed into a
mighty ugly situation.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>As a matter of fact, he could see no immediate way out
of it.</p>

<p>He was so cramped and twisted in his close quarters
that he could not draw his revolver without rising up in
the hamper, and he knew that the dog would instantly
attack him if he ventured doing that.</p>

<p>His muscles were so cramped, moreover, that he
knew he could not move to advantage for several moments
after his release.</p>

<p>He realized, furthermore, that the report of his revolver,
in case he attempted to shoot the dog, would
speedily bring Badger and his confederates to the spot,
and that the result might possibly be fatal to himself, or,
at least, to Nick’s designs, to corner and arrest the entire
gang.</p>

<p>So for upward of five minutes the situation hung fire,
Patsy waiting and wondering, and the bloodhound still
growling and trotting to and fro some six feet away.</p>

<p>It was at this time that Badger had his talk with Nick,
as already related.</p>

<p>Presently Patsy heard Conley returning, accompanied
by the two women.</p>

<p>Though all three observed the dog, they paid no immediate
attention to his movements, but at once hastened<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
into the inner basement and to the vault in which
Nick was confined.</p>

<p>Patsy inwardly prayed that the dog would follow
them, but his prayer proved vain.</p>

<p>The bloodhound knew his business.</p>

<p>He continued to trot and growl, occasionally snapping
his huge jaws by diversion or anticipation, and all the
while with his red eyes fixed upon the wicker hamper.</p>

<p>Patsy gritted his own teeth in impotent rage.</p>

<p>At the end of another five minutes, however, he had
decided what to do.</p>

<p>He resolved to shoot the dog, taking chances of killing
him with a single shot, and then leap out of the
hamper and attack, single-handed, the gang in the interior
basement.</p>

<p>Conley had left the sliding door open after entering
with the women, and Patsy thought he could see a tolerably
fair prospect of bringing to a successful issue even
as desperate a move as that which he now contemplated.</p>

<p>Having grimly settled upon the task, he now wormed
about a bit in the hamper, striving to free his revolver
from his hip pocket.</p>

<p>The bloodhound instantly redoubled his growling.</p>

<p>“You be hanged!” muttered Patsy resentfully. “I’ll
presently silence you with a chunk of lead.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>He had succeeded in getting hold of the butt of his
revolver.</p>

<p>Before he could free the weapon from his pocket,
however, the shrill voice of Vic Clayton sounded through
the basement, as she and Claudia Badger came hurrying
from the inner extension.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with Pluto?” she cried, as she approached.</p>

<p>“There’s something wrong out here,” declared Claudia.</p>

<p>The instant the dog heard his name mentioned, all the
restrained passions and fierce instincts of the brute
leaped violently into play.</p>

<p>With a tremendous snarling and barking he bounded
up at the hamper, clawing at it with might and main, as
if bent upon devouring all that it contained.</p>

<p>Patsy was taking no chances of losing half of his
face in one fierce bite of the brute, and he instantly
ducked his head and crouched lower.</p>

<p>“It’s all off!” was the thought that flashed through
his mind. “I am now obliged to put up a game of
bluff.”</p>

<p>The screams of the two women were now mingled
with the furious barking of the bloodhound, and Vic
Clayton was shouting affrightedly:</p>

<p>“Come out here! Come out here, Amos! There’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
something the matter with this dog. I think he has gone
mad.”</p>

<p>Before the last was uttered, both Badger and Conley
came rushing out of the inner cellar.</p>

<p>The two men instantly guessed the meaning of the
brute’s actions, and both rushed toward the car.</p>

<p>“Gone mad be hanged!” shouted Badger. “There’s
something wrong with that hamper, not with the dog.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Amos,” yelled Conley.</p>

<p>“Ah, I thought so! Get out, you brute, or I’ll brain
you! What the devil have we here?”</p>

<p>Badger had given the excited brute a second kick in
the ribs, that once more sent him yelping out of doors,
much to Patsy’s relief, despite the sudden change in the
situation.</p>

<p>At the same time Conley had thrown open the lid of
the hamper, plainly disclosing the cramped detective to
the view of all.</p>

<p>In an instant both ruffians had him by the throat
and wrists.</p>

<p>“Hold on!” gasped Patsy, struggling to rise out of
his cramped position, and at once assuming to be the
injured, rather than the offender.</p>

<p>“Come out here!”</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll come out,” whined Patsy, as he was yanked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
out upon the ground, yet still in the clutches of both
men. “Say, this ain’t no way to use a fellow. Let go
me throat, will you? I ain’t going to eat nobody up.
Holy smoke! but I’m glad you drove that dog off. I
thought I was a dead one, for sure.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be a dead one, all right, young fellow, unless
you stand up and give an account of yourself,” Badger
fiercely cried. “Hang onto his arms, there, Conley, in
case he means mischief. Hand me that strip of rope,
Vic, and I’ll make him fast in a jiffy. Look lively, I
say!”</p>

<p>While this exchange of conversation was in progress,
Patsy had been jerked rudely to his feet, only to find
for several moments that he could hardly stand erect,
so strained and cramped were his muscles.</p>

<p>Conley, meantime, had twisted the captive’s arms
back of him, and was holding them there with the grip
of a vise.</p>

<p>Badger had released Patsy’s throat, however, and,
with the piece of rope Vic Clayton had hurriedly brought
him, he quickly secured the detective’s arms and wrists
behind him.</p>

<p>“Now, you give an account of yourself,” he fiercely
commanded, shaking his clenched hand under Patsy’s
nose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure I will, mister, since I’m caught in my own box,”
Patsy now said, surveying with a ludicrous grin the
frowning faces around him. “But I’d have been out
and away long before this, mister, if it had not been
for that infernal dog.”</p>

<p>“Out and away, would you?” cried Badger, catching
up this one significant remark.</p>

<p>“That’s what, mister.”</p>

<p>“What were you doing in that hamper?”</p>

<p>“Only stealing a ride.”</p>

<p>“Stealing a ride?” echoed Badger incredulously.</p>

<p>“That was all, mister, the whole business.”</p>

<p>“You’re a liar!” snarled Conley, fiercely suspicious.</p>

<p>“Say, you leave me to settle with the boss of this
joint, will you?” growled Patsy, now turning upon the
Irishman. “I haven’t trod on any of your corns, have I?
So you leave me to do the talking with the boss.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not leave you a leg to stand on, if you——”</p>

<p>“Shut up, Jerry!” commanded Badger sharply. “How
long had you been in the hamper, youngster?”</p>

<p>“All the way from town, mister.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” cried Vic Clayton, now pressing nearer.
“I know better than that.”</p>

<p>“Sure, ma’am, I don’t like to contradict a lady like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
yourself, but you’ll find I’m right,” insisted Patsy, bowing
to her with a ludicrous display of humility.</p>

<p>“Do you mean to say that you rode out from town in
that hamper?” demanded Vic.</p>

<p>“That’s what I did, ma’am.”</p>

<p>“What put you up to that?” cried Badger, in threatening
tones.</p>

<p>Patsy indulged in another grin.</p>

<p>“Well, ’twas like this, mister, d’ye see,” he proceeded
to explain, with an air of humble frankness. “I was
walking along Tremont Street with a comrade of mine—Jones
his name is, mister, and mine is Green.”</p>

<p>“Come to the point, you rascal,” Badger impatiently
growled.</p>

<p>“Sure I will, mister, if you give me time.”</p>

<p>“If you don’t, I’ll give you something besides time.”</p>

<p>“’Twas like this, d’ye see?” continued Patsy coolly.
“We saw this big car alongside the curb on Tremont
Street, and Nosey, the which we call Jones because his
beak is so big—Nosey bet me a five I didn’t dare get into
the hamper and steal a ride.”</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” sneered Badger, with an ugly gleam in
his searching eyes.</p>

<p>“That’s what he did, sir,” nodded Patsy. “I’d seen
these two ladies go into the building near-by, so I said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
to myself I’d have time to duck into the hamper before
they came out. I thought it a cinch to win a five in
that easy way. So when I found it was empty, mister,
in I jumped, and here I am—the which I wouldn’t be,
only for that dog, I give you my blooming word.”</p>

<p>“Your blooming word doesn’t cut any ice with me,”
Conley now declared, with an angry snarl. “I’ll not
swallow this story, Badger, not on your life. It’s much
more likely that he’s working with his nobs in yonder,
and mebbe there are more of the same kind about here
at this moment.”</p>

<p>This possibility suggested by Conley was not without
immediate effect upon Badger, who turned quickly to the
waiting women and cried sharply:</p>

<p>“Go over to the house, you two, and we’ll bring this
rascal there and question him further. You, Jerry, close
that sliding door. We’ll leave the other where we have
him. He cannot get out, that’s sure, and I’ll take no
chance that there are others to see us in this place. We’ll
go over to the house and settle with this young cub.”</p>

<p>“That will be safest,” nodded Conley, as he hastened
to obey.</p>

<p>“You may leave this oil-lamp burning, Jerry,” added
Badger, as he seized Patsy by the collar and marched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
him toward the door. “We may have to come out here
again.”</p>

<p>“I’ll not put it out.”</p>

<p>“But secure this door after you.”</p>

<p>“Sure! D’ye think I’m daffy enough to leave it
open?”</p>

<p>With the last remark, Conley came out of the basement
and closed the heavy door, leaving the entire place
only dimly lighted by the oil-lamp on the wall.</p>

<p>Seen from outside, the whole stable appeared shrouded
in darkness.</p>

<p>As the three started across the lawn toward the house,
with Patsy in the grip of both men, the huge bloodhound
came bounding over the grass as if to accompany them—or
to make a finish of Patsy.</p>

<p>Badger quickly checked him, however, sternly commanding:</p>

<p>“Be off, Pluto! Away with you, and watch out, you
brute! Watch out, I say!”</p>

<p>The dog appeared to understand. He dropped his
black nose to the ground, vented one short, sharp yelp,
then coursed away with the speed of a deer, hither and
thither, and finally toward the belt of woods darkly outlined
against the starry sky at the rear of the broad
estate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>“He’ll notify us, Jerry!” growled Badger, with his grip
unconsciously tightening on the detective’s collar. “Let
Pluto alone for that. He’ll notify us all right, and
promptly, too, if there are other strangers prowling near
here to-night.”</p>

<p>That Patsy was possessed of that true detective genius
which instinctively anticipates coming events, appears in
the thought that quickly arose in his mind:</p>

<p>“He will, eh? I can see his finish if he encounters
Chick Carter this night!”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.
<br />
<small>A LAST RESORT.</small></h2>


<p>“Search him!” sternly commanded Badger. “We’ll
see what that will bring forth. Search him, Conley, and
see what you can find!”</p>

<p>The scene was the kitchen of the Badger dwelling.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes had passed since Patsy was rounded
up and brought in there, and the quarter-hour had been
devoted to plying him with questions to break down the
crafty story he had told, and to which he clung with
a tenacity born of conscious desperation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span></p>

<p>He now stood with his back to one of the kitchen
walls, in the full glare of the lamplight.</p>

<p>His arms were still secured behind him, and his collar
and cravat were awry from the throttling he had received.</p>

<p>His face was composed, however, not even pale, and
his eyes were keen and bright with that inherent courage
and invincible determination which rendered him superior
to any threatening situation, and eminently worthy to
have become Nick Carter’s trusted associate and assistant.</p>

<p>The gang by which he had been so curiously cornered
were seated about the room.</p>

<p>Both Badger and Conley appeared stern and ugly,
evincing that state of mind when dread and suspicion
battle with uncertainty.</p>

<p>The two women, Mrs. Badger and Vic Clayton, appeared
pale and anxious, as if fearful that their adventurous
career was likely to be seriously interrupted.</p>

<p>Yet all four, including also a dark, middle-aged woman
who worked in the house, were regarding Patsy with
eyes and aspects so threatening as to have awed one less
cool, collected, and defiant of personal peril.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes had passed, as mentioned, and from
this time matters moved decisively and swiftly, with all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the energies of these masterful detectives instinctively
strained for what each knew must be a final move, and
all operating to produce the one desirable culmination
of their joint endeavors.</p>

<p>In response to Badger’s command, Conley sprang up
and began to search Patsy, fiercely thrusting his hand into
one pocket and then another.</p>

<p>“Leave the linings,” suggested Patsy, with a defiant
grin.</p>

<p>He knew that he had on his person only one article
that would point to his vocation, which he was prepared
to deny in the face even of that.</p>

<p>It came to light in a moment—his trusty revolver.</p>

<p>“Aha! what’s this?” cried Conley, as he yanked the
weapon from Patsy’s hip pocket. “So you carry a gun,
do you?”</p>

<p>“Sure I do,” asserted Patsy coolly. “You’d carry a
gun, too, if there were as many rats in your cellar as
there are in mine.”</p>

<p>“It’s you who are the rat,” Badger angrily growled, as
his confederate displayed the weapon.</p>

<p>“You’re wrong, mister,” insisted Patsy. “I’m a ratter,
but no rat.”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean by that?” snarled Conley fiercely.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>“I mean that I’m a hunter of rats,” said Patsy, with
dry significance.</p>

<p>“You’re a detective,” cried Badger.</p>

<p>“That’s what he is, Amos,” supplemented Vic Clayton,
white with increased apprehensions. “He must be
one of the Boston force.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not.”</p>

<p>“Not one of the force?”</p>

<p>“Nothing of the kind.”</p>

<p>“If you are lying, youngster, the lie will as surely cost
you your life——”</p>

<p>What more Badger would have uttered can only be
conjectured, for, while he was speaking, fiercely shaking
his fist at Patsy’s helpless head, there sounded from the
gravel driveway outside and over the hollow planking of
the veranda the heavy fall of hurrying feet.</p>

<p>“Who’s this?” cried Claudia, starting affrightedly from
her chair.</p>

<p>“The door, Conley!” hissed Badger. “Have the gun
ready!”</p>

<p>Before Conley could reach the doorway, however, toward
which he hastened with Patsy’s revolver in his
hand, it was hurriedly opened and a sallow-featured,
green-eyed rascal bounded breathlessly into the kitchen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>“Oh, it’s Sandy Hyde!” exclaimed Vic, with a little
scream of satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Who the devil is he?” thought Patsy, sharply regarding
the panting scamp.</p>

<p>Though this advent of Hyde brought a look of relief
to the face of each, Badger kept a taut rein on the threatening
business then on hand, and he almost immediately
demanded:</p>

<p>“What brings you out here, Sandy?”</p>

<p>“Wait till I get my breath, and I’ll tell you,” panted
Hyde. “I’ve run all the way from the trolley. The chief
kept me at work till half an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Is there something wrong at headquarters?” snarled
Badger quickly.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” muttered Patsy mentally. “A spy
from the chief’s office, or I’ll eat my boots! By thunder!
it’s no wonder that this case has baffled the efforts of the
Boston force.”</p>

<p>Patsy was quick enough to see all it meant, in case
he was correct in his immediate conjecture.</p>

<p>Sandy Hyde, who had paused a moment to get a drink
of water at the kitchen sink, now hastened to reply to
Badger’s question.</p>

<p>“Wrong at headquarters? I should say so!” he cried.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
“I have just got wise to something, less than an hour
ago. Who’s that chap?”</p>

<p>“Never mind him at present,” cried Badger, with terrific
impatience. “What have you learned?”</p>

<p>“Nick Carter has an assistant here on this case,” replied
Hyde.</p>

<p>“Not Chick Carter!”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen him?”</p>

<p>“Sure! He was at headquarters about five o’clock.”</p>

<p>“For what?”</p>

<p>“He was trying to locate Nick.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got Nick, all right,” sneered Badger, with a
chuckle of derision. “But this other, this Chick Carter,
of whom I have frequently heard, I don’t know him by
sight.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” put in Conley, frowning near-by.</p>

<p>“You’re sure this is not he?”</p>

<p>“Dead sure,” cried Hyde, with a glance at Patsy. “I
don’t know this chap.”</p>

<p>“Then he is not one of the Boston force,” declared
Vic, more hopefully. “He did not lie about that.”</p>

<p>Badger turned again to Patsy, lowering and dark, and
Patsy gained a point by saying quickly:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>“Sure I didn’t lie about it. I wouldn’t lie to ladies
and gents like you.”</p>

<p>“No, this fellow is not a Boston detective, I’ll swear
to that,” Hyde now declared. “I know them all.”</p>

<p>“But Chick Carter——” began Badger.</p>

<p>“Oh, he doesn’t look like this chap,” interrupted Hyde.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t, eh?”</p>

<p>“Not a bit! Chick Carter is older, a sturdy, well-built
young man, with smooth, clean-cut features
and——”</p>

<p>“Stop!” screamed Vic Clayton, suddenly leaping out of
her chair.</p>

<p>“Well?”</p>

<p>“How was he dressed when you saw him at five
o’clock?”</p>

<p>“Why, he said he was going to your office,” cried
Hyde, now getting back to the business that had brought
him out there. “He had on a plaid suit, a polka-dotted
cravat——”</p>

<p>“Henderson!” screamed Vic, all of a quiver with excitement.
“That man Henderson, Amos, was Chick
Carter!”</p>

<p>“Not a doubt of it!” gasped Claudia Badger, as white
as the knot of lace at her throat.</p>

<p>“And that’s why he inquired after Nick Carter,” declared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
Badger, now beginning to see that a network
might already be closing around him.</p>

<p>“That’s what, Amos.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where Chick Carter went after leaving
your rooms, Vic?”</p>

<p>“Of course not. How should I?”</p>

<p>“He might have said.”</p>

<p>“He said he was going to Carter’s hotel.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I do know, however,” cried Vic,
hit with an afterthought.</p>

<p>“What’s that?”</p>

<p>“I know that this young devil must have got into that
hamper while Chick Carter was in my rooms, Amos, and
it’s a hundred to one that the two were at work on this
case together.”</p>

<p>“Gee! she’s hit me good and hard this time,” thought
Patsy, wishing he might have throttled her to silence.
“Now there will be something doing, I’ll go the limit on
that.”</p>

<p>He read aright the faces of those around him.</p>

<p>The significance of Vic Clayton’s declaration was utterly
irresistible.</p>

<p>“What do you say to that?” thundered Badger, striding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
closer to Patsy, with his features livid and convulsed
with rage.</p>

<p>“I dunno what she’s talking about,” protested Patsy
coolly.</p>

<p>“You lie!” roared Conley. “You are one of Nick
Carter’s helpers, or——”</p>

<p>“Stop a bit!” interrupted Badger, with frightful austerity.
“We’ll soon know whether he is or not!”</p>

<p>“What d’ye mean?”</p>

<p>“I’ll get the truth out of him!” snorted Badger. “Bring
him after me, back to the garage. I’ll make him confess
the truth and tell us where we stand. We’ll string
him up by the neck to one of the beams—and there he
shall hang unless he tells the whole truth! Bring him
along, you two, and look lively! I’ll go on ahead and
open the doors.”</p>

<p>“Yes, there’s something doing!” thought Patsy, contemplating
his imminent peril. “They are going to try
hanging me—but they’ll try in vain! Yet I rather hope
Chick may show up in time to save my precious neck.”</p>

<p>These thoughts passed through Patsy’s mind while
he was being rudely hustled out of doors by Conley and
Hyde, while Amos Badger hurried on in advance.</p>

<p>Both women followed, too alarmed by the impending
peril to endure the suspense of remaining behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>“They care nothing for me, or my neck,” thought
Patsy. “Like the she devils of ancient Rome, once
having tasted blood, they thirst for more.”</p>

<p>As he was hurried into the basement by Conley, he
saw that the sliding door had been opened and that
Badger was again lighting the lantern.</p>

<p>This no sooner was done than the dastardly knave,
blind to all except the impulses of his utter desperation,
quickly threw a rope over a beam near the ceiling, then
knotted a slip-noose around Patsy’s neck.</p>

<p>Patsy stood directly under the beam, as cool as if he
was only about to be weighed.</p>

<p>“Get hold of that rope, you two!” cried Badger
fiercely.</p>

<p>Conley and Hyde sprang to the lax strip of line.</p>

<p>The two women, bred though they were to evil, drew
back with awed white faces and dilated eyes.</p>

<p>“Now, youngster, what do you say?” thundered Badger,
confronting Patsy with face livid and eyes ablaze.</p>

<p>Patsy met him eye to eye.</p>

<p>“Only what I’ve said already,” he curtly replied.</p>

<p>“Nothing more?”</p>

<p>“Nothing more, mister!”</p>

<p>“Nor less?”</p>

<p>“Nor less!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span></p>

<p>“Up with him!” roared Badger, turning fiercely to his
confederates.</p>

<p>Patsy felt the rope draw taut around his neck.</p>

<p>Just then, however, from some quarter outside, there
rang out upon the still evening air the sharp, spiteful
crack of a revolver.</p>

<p>It was mingled with a single agonized yelp—and a
bloodhound lay stretched upon the greensward, shot
squarely between his eyes!</p>

<small>NICK CARTER’S ESCAPE.</small></h2>


<p>Silence and darkness.</p>

<p>It was in these that Nick Carter was left confined at
an earlier hour that eventful evening, bound hand and
foot, and with his back propped against the cold stone
wall of the disused wine-vault.</p>

<p>It would be an injustice to him, however, to those
inherent qualities and rare abilities which had made him
what he was, to neglect depicting his movements during
the time his captors were so pressingly engaged with
Patsy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>

<p>Of Chick and Patsy’s discoveries and designs since he
parted from them at the Adams House that morning,
Nick, of course, was entirely ignorant.</p>

<p>That they had so quickly suspected something wrong
because of his absence, or that he could depend upon
them for any immediate assistance, he did not for a moment
imagine. For it was then only a few hours after
the time they had agreed to meet, and any ordinary incident
might have detained him that long.</p>

<p>Yet Amos Badger had no sooner closed the door of
the wine-vault than Nick Carter began to think about
making his escape.</p>

<p>“Whatever I accomplish,” he said to himself, “I must
accomplish alone. There is not much chance that Chick
and Patsy have yet discovered any clue to my whereabouts,
even if they now suspect that I have met with
some beastly mishap, so I must figure upon playing a
lone hand in getting out of this place. I’ll make the
attempt, at least, and if——Hello! what’s the meaning
of that, I wonder?”</p>

<p>From some quarter outside, borne faintly to his ears,
had come the furious barking of a dog, mingled with
the shouts of men and the screams of women.</p>

<p>For half a minute Nick listened intently, but the startling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
sounds were not prolonged, and presently only silence
reigned in the wine-vault.</p>

<p>Stop a bit—not quite silence only!</p>

<p>From one corner came a faint noise which Nick’s ear
was quick to detect.</p>

<p>It was the steady drip, drip, drip of water, from some
point higher than the floor.</p>

<p>Nick recalled seeing a stagnant pool in the corner from
which the dripping sounded, and he rightly inferred that
there must be some water-supply above, possibly in the
stable, and that a considerable leak existed.</p>

<p>“My first work must be that of getting my hands at
liberty,” he soliloquized, after a few moments.</p>

<p>They were tied behind him, but that mattered little to
Nick Carter.</p>

<p>While the lantern was in the vault, during his talk
with Badger, Nick had visually examined the surrounding
stone walls, and had discovered several places where
the rough corners of the stones protruded a little, forming
tolerably sharp edges.</p>

<p>Against one of these he backed, after rising to his
feet with some difficulty, until he could bring the rope
about his wrists to bear against the edge of the stone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Then he began sawing it up and down, at an expense
of some little skin from his knuckles, and at the
end of five minutes he felt one of the strands give and
break. Then, with a mighty effort, he succeeded in
breaking the entire rope, and the liberation of his hands
at once became easy.</p>

<p>“Now, if you come down here, Badger, you’ll meet
with a warmer reception than before,” he determinedly
muttered, while he set to work at the ropes around his
ankles.</p>

<p>In three minutes his limbs also were free, and Nick
coolly tossed the ropes aside.</p>

<p>“Next, to find a way out of here,” was his mental
comment.</p>

<p>He had observed that no window existed, and he had
but little hope of being able to force the heavy door,
having been deprived of his knife and revolver.</p>

<p>After examining the door, to which he groped through
the darkness, he decided that he could accomplish nothing
there.</p>

<p>The constant dripping of the water could still be
heard, however, and Nick now shrewdly reasoned:</p>

<p>“That water must have some avenue of escape, and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
may run under the foundation wall in that corner. If
it does, the soil should be soft and muddy, and I may
be able to dig my way out, or, at least, to work under
the wall and learn what lies beyond it. I’ll give it a try,
at all events.”</p>

<p>As he groped toward the corner, he stumbled over
one of the empty beer-kegs previously mentioned.</p>

<p>“Ha! here’s just the thing, providing I can smash it,”
he said to himself. “One of these oak staves will serve
admirably for a spade.”</p>

<p>Gripping the keg by the chimes, he hurled it with all
of his strength against one of the walls.</p>

<p>There was a double effect.</p>

<p>First, the keg snapped and cracked loudly, as several
of the staves yielded under the terrific blow.</p>

<p>Second, an instant later, a bit of rock from the wall
fell with a splash into the pool of water.</p>

<p>Nick then examined the wall.</p>

<p>He found that the constant leakage from above had
softened the old cement and mortar, and that the stones
in this locality might be removed with almost any stout
implement.</p>

<p>In half a minute he had the beer-keg demolished and
one of the stout staves in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>With this he next attacked the stonework near the
pool, and for ten minutes he worked as vigorously and
rapidly as the darkness permitted.</p>

<p>Then he had two of the lower stones hauled out of
the wall, and a space made large enough to crawl
through.</p>

<p>Listening at this opening, he could now detect another
sound quite near-by. It was the occasional stamping of
horses, evidently in their stalls.</p>

<p>“H’m!” grunted Nick. “I’m not sure that I’m out of
the place, after all. This hole will evidently lead me
into a basement under the stable, or the carriage-house.
By Jove! it may be that Badger has a place of concealment
down here for his horses, those occasionally used
for a hold-up. I’ll speedily ascertain.”</p>

<p>Crawling with some little difficulty through the hole
in the wall, Nick rose to his feet on the outer side, and
groped carefully through the gloom.</p>

<p>Suddenly his extended hands came in contact with—an
automobile!</p>

<p>He was in the interior garage, the secret hiding-place
of Badger’s several cars.</p>

<p>It had taken Nick half an hour to accomplish all this,
however, and before he could fix upon anything definite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
as to his present location, he heard voices outside, and a
door hurriedly opened.</p>

<p>“H’m!” he mentally grunted. “Are my captors returning?
They’ll find me ready for them this time!”</p>

<p>Then he crouched quickly back of the car with which
he had come in contact.</p>

<p>The sliding door had suddenly opened, and the light
from the wall lamp outside shot into the extension cellar.</p>

<p>The instant Nick’s eyes fell upon the row of automobiles,
he guessed the whole truth concerning the place.</p>

<p>His interest, however, chiefly centered in two men
who were hurriedly rushing a third into the place, closely
followed by two women, while Badger was hastening to
light a lantern.</p>

<p>“Good Heaven!” mentally exclaimed Nick. “Their
captive is Patsy!”</p>

<p>He watched and waited, deducing more and more
from the little he heard, and all the while his stern white
features, still swathed with bandages, grew hard as flint.</p>

<p>Patsy felt the rope tighten about his neck.</p>

<p>Then sounded the revolver-shot from outside.</p>

<p>Next a dark form bounded out from back of the touring-car—bounded
out with the leap of an angry lion.</p>

<p>Two clenched hands rose and fell, and two men dragging
upon a rope cast over a beam were sent senseless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
to the earth, quivering in every muscle, as an ox quivers
when felled in the shambles.</p>

<p>Then two hands closed around Amos Badger’s throat,
and in the miscreant’s ears rang a voice and words that
took all the strength and manhood, if any of the latter
was there, completely out of him.</p>

<p>“It will be you, Badger, not I!”</p>

<p>“Whoop la!” shrieked Patsy. “It’s Nick himself!”</p>

<p>Two women, frightened for their miserable lives,
turned and ran toward the open door—only to rush into
the ready arms of Chick Carter.</p>

<p>Chick had arrived at the edge of the woods only a
short time before, and had seen Patsy brought out of
the house and into the basement of the garage. Hastening
to cross the lawn and lend a hand, as he had promised,
Chick had encountered the bloodhound, killing him
with a single well-directed shot, and then had rushed on
and into the garage, just in time to head off Vic Clayton
and Claudia Badger when they turned to flee.</p>

<p>The rest may be briefly told, for a more complete and
successful round-up could hardly be imagined. In less
than ten minutes the entire gang were in irons, and thirty
minutes later they were taking a ride in the local patrol-wagon,
instead of a Packard car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>The exposure of their rascally scheme also was complete
when the case came to trial, a little later, for Nick
Carter found in and about the house and stable ample
evidence to prove that his deductions had from the very
first been entirely correct.</p>

<p>Fortunately, too, he found letters and clues enabling
him to trace much of the stolen property upon which
Badger had realized thousands of dollars, and which ultimately
was restored to its rightful owners.</p>

<p>In Badger’s safe Nick found his own watch and chain,
but the money of which he had been robbed was missing.
He had in his success with the case, however, a
reward that far more than offset his trivial loss.</p>

<p>Dumfounded when informed by what means the Boston
detectives had been baffled in their efforts to discover
these road robbers, Chief Weston’s gratitude to Nick was
equaled only by his bitterness for Sandy Hyde, and he
made sure that the treacherous scamp should receive a
sentence as long as the others of the Badger gang—and
that was one of years.</p>

<p>Long before the release of any of them, the Badger
place near Brookline had passed into other hands, sold
under a heavy mortgage, and from that time Tremont
Street knew the notorious Madame Victoria no more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>One and all of them passed, as they deserved, out of
the public mind and out of the hearts and lives of friendly
acquaintances—from the moment that Nick Carter
showed them in their true colors and closed upon them
the door of a prison cell.</p>

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
